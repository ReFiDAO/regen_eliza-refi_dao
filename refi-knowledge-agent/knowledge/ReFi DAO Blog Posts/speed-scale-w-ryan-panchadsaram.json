Where solutions exist, social and financial barriers to achieving meaningful scale can often get in the way.</p><p>As 27 COP meetings have demonstrated, implementing and managing climate solutions is much more challenging than simply agreeing that action is required or establishing commitments to act. </p><h2 id=\"ryans-thoughts-and-approach\">Ryan's Thoughts and Approach</h2><p>OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results, an outcomes management tool discussed in depth in <em>Measure What Matters</em>. They address the critical facets of any goal worth achieving: the “what” and the “how.” Objectives are what you aim to accomplish. Key Results (KRs) tell us how the objectives get done.</p><p>If any goal could be considered \"worth achieving\", solving the climate crisis would certainly qualify. In the interview with John and Simar, Ryan explains how applying OKR's to the climate crisis is introduced in the Speed &amp; Scale book - which ultimately generated 10 separate objectives and 55 associated key results, all explorable in the <a href=\"https://speedandscale.com/tracker/\">online tracker here</a>. </p><p>Listen to the full conversation above to learn more about Ryan, how Kleiner Perkins is helping to accelerate and scale up climate solutions, and hear his thoughts on everything from carbon markets to the future of money will shape a sustainable planet going forward.</p><h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.panchadsaram.com/\">Ryan - Website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rypan\">Ryan - Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.kleinerperkins.com/ \">KleinerPerkins</a></p><p><a href=\" https://speedandscale.com/tracker/\">Speed &amp; Scale</a></p>",
