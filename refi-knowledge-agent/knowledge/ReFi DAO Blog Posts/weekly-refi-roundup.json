Yet somehow, when you combine the two things accelerate even faster. The ReFi movement is moving fast and pushing boundaries on all sides.</p><p>We're grateful to have the opportunity to collaborate with the MCJ community to make sense of it all and create new friendships. It's humbling participate in this amazing community of builders, entrepreneurs, investors and climate scientists.</p><p>If you're interested to learn more about ReFi or get involved, feel free to reach out to me at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/climateXcrypto\">@climateXcrypto</a>, our friends at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToucanProtocol\">@ToucanProtocol</a> or the community emerging at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiDAOist\">@ReFiDAOist</a> for more information!</p><p></p>",
