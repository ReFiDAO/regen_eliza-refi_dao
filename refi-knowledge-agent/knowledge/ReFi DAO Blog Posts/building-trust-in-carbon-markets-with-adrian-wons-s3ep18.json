Senken aims to make voluntary carbon offsetting as straightforward as possible, enhancing the market's credibility and trust through a decentralized, on-chain infrastructure. This infrastructure ensures transparency and traceability of carbon credits. The marketplace allows users to compare, buy, trade, and use these credits for carbon emission offsetting, making these processes accessible to a broader range of investors and companies than was previously possible. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1396\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-2.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/image-2.png 1396w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </em></i><a href=\"https://www.senken.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Senken</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>Senken aims to fund $10 billion into the climate market by 2030. Adrian shares that the motivation behind building Senken was the lack of transparency in carbon markets and the disparity between the price at which carbon credits are sold and the amount received by project developers. This focus on transparency and efficiency is central to Senken's mission in the carbon credit market.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🤔&nbsp;How do you select good carbon credits?<br><br>With so many climate projects available, it can be difficult to know where to start<br><br>🔎&nbsp;Explore the different <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/carboncredit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#carboncredit</a> types and find out what a high-quality climate project should look like: <a href=\"https://t.co/6GBDWHpbRD\">https://t.co/6GBDWHpbRD</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateAction?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ClimateAction</a></p>— senken (@senken_io) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/senken_io/status/1626153662308392961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><hr><h2 id=\"redefining-climate-accountability-%F0%9F%A4%9D\">Redefining Climate Accountability 🤝</h2><p>Adrian and John delve into the complex landscape of climate action and the media's tendency to focus on companies actively trying to make a difference, often ignoring those who remain inactive.
