We’re changing that narrative by creating regenerative finance models that allow forests to generate revenue through protection, not extraction.</em></i></div></div><p>Key insights from Episode 5 include... 💡</p><ul><li><strong>Rights to Regenerate:</strong> Pete explains how British Columbia's indigenous-led cooperatives are turning the tables on traditional logging by securing rights to regenerate, not extract. This creates a long-term, sustainable way to manage forests.</li><li><strong>Indigenous Leadership at the Core:</strong> Pete highlights the vital role that indigenous knowledge plays in protecting forests. These communities have been caring for the land for generations, and empowering them is key to effective conservation.</li><li><strong>Transforming Economic Models:</strong> Pete shows how regenerative finance can provide an economic alternative that benefits both people and the planet. Instead of focusing on extraction, these models value ecosystems as living assets that need to be protected and nurtured.</li><li><strong>Moving Beyond Carbon Offsets:</strong> Carbon credits are just one part of the equation. Pete talks about the broader ecological benefits of forests, like improving biodiversity and water quality, and how we can capture and measure these impacts.</li></ul><p>🎧 <strong>Tune in to Episode 5</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6f2on7Yvk5Ywe2iHqFzOT2?si=8k-IO2PBTbi2uWGiaTu2tQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spotify</a></li><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/refi-podcast/id1609683147?i=1000673863714\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apple</a></li><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/GpkKQcKhMW0?si=BRgbsRPmhgswL-Sc\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YouTube</a></li></ul><p>And don’t forget!
