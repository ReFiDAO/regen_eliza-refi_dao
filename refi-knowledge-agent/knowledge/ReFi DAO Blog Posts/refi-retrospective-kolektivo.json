During the event, the Wallet was downloaded 299 times ‚Äî 151 on iOS and 148 on Android. Each user was airdropped a small sum of kG and CELO (to cover gas fees). Festival‚Äôs attendees redeemed their kG for food and drink during the event at three designated vendors. In total, 76 users utilized the community currency (see below for details).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1238/1*1yuJtX4QviQbQQ0bkWqtdQ.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"619\" height=\"790\"><figcaption><em class=\"nx\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">Report prepared by Zed Labs</em></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the launch was a remarkable success. The vast majority of transactions were carried out without fail. A few vendors were onboarded during the event and used the application without much difficulty or training ‚Äî validating the Wallet‚Äôs simplicity and intuitiveness. Many vendors reported that it was innovative and easy to use.</p><p>Almost all attendees had a phone capable of supporting the wallet. The smart contract that airdropped kG and CELO to freshly onboarded users worked smoothly and users were able to spend their funds instantly.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1320/1*EqmPXGqkg9krJd5pTvr4Rg.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"843\"><figcaption><em class=\"nx\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">Report prepared by Zed Labs</em></figcaption></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, some difficulties were encountered during the Wallet launch. As with all new applications, user feedback is of immense value and will direct future improvements of the Wallet:</p><ul><li>Some technical issues were reported, likely related to poor internet connectivity.</li><li>Some users encountered minor user interface issues which the team noted for future optimization. The Wallet had display issues with phones with smaller than average screens or in which the text size had been manually enlarged.</li><li>For the launch, the Wallet utilized a Testflight instance, given that this was its first test in a production environment. Its absence from the native iOS and Android App stores was confusing for many users and required handholding to complete installation.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qQ00uZJ39q5xcEcL_M1wZA.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\"><figcaption><em class=\"nx\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">The support team was available anytime to onboard new users.

The region‚Äôs immense biodiversity and key role in global finance designate it as an apt area for ReFi to take shape. The event was an opportunity to familiarize hundreds of <em><em>local </em></em>people with Web3 and Kolektivo, while simultaneously familiarizing Web3-<em><em>global </em></em>visitors with the Caribbean impact and technology ecosystem.</p><p>We hope to see the Festival‚Äôs impulse and local-global collaboration continue to grow as we work hard to finalize the first version of the core Kolektivo Framework tools.
