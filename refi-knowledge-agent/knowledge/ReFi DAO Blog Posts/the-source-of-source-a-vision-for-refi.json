I had already been working in the sustainability and impact space for 13 years through my creative agency <a href=\"https://creativeseed.co.za/\"><u>Seed</u></a>. I started exploring crypto in 2018 and delved into NFTs in late 2021 and early 2022. When I saw an open role at Toucan it resonated with me so deeply that I pursued it with determination, reaching out to multiple team members online until I secured the position. This marked my first real exposure to ReFi. The potential of tokenizing assets that have a positive impact on our planet captivated me. I realized that through ReFi, we could unlock funding, speed, and scale that traditional systems couldn't match.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also introduced to the concept of regeneration versus sustainability‚Äîhighlighting that sustainability as a concept is just insufficient. We can do better. We need to rethink and recreate our systems to enable them to enrich the ecosystems they inhabit on a personal, community, and ecological level.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.23.31-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1124\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.23.31-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.23.31-AM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.23.31-AM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.23.31-AM.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><blockquote>It is my deep desire to be part of the solution. When I found ReFi I felt like I found a home, I was not alone in this mission to enact change.</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-birth-of-source\">The Birth of Source</h3><p>After a year at Toucan, where I learned some of the nuances of ReFi and saw its potential first-hand, it was time to move on. I will be forever grateful for my time at Toucan, the amazing people I met, the things I learnt and the perspective shift it enabled for me. When I first onboarded at Toucan I met <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbellison/?originalSubdomain=pt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">John Ellison</a>, who had then just founded ReFi DAO. John's vision for storytelling and a decentralized world aligned perfectly with my aspirations. Our conversations led to the birth of <a href=\"https://www.wearesource.earth/\"><u>Source </u></a>with the initial intention to help produce podcasts within the ReFi community to help give voice to the regenerative stories of the ecosystem.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.32.06-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.32.06-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.32.06-AM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.32.06-AM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.32.06-AM.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.24.15-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.24.15-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.24.15-AM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.24.15-AM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.24.15-AM.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>During that time we produced and launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLArKB4hKFyGFgwEYtARwXPf21oOH9eKSx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ReFi Podcast Season 3</a> and two new podcasts ‚Äì <a href=\"https://twitter.com/podplanta_r?ref=blog.refidao.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Planta-R</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>in Portuguese from ReFi Lisboa and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vagabonds_pod?ref=blog.refidao.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Vagabonds</em></a> in Spanish from ReFi Costa Rica.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"__GHOST_URL__/launching-planta-r-and-vagabonds-podcasts/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Launching Planta-R and Vagabonds Podcasts! üéôÔ∏èüìªüéâ</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">We are celebrating the launch of two incredible podcasts in Spanish and Portuguese - Vagabonds and Planta-R!

This could involve creating a token of ownership to replace traditional funding and ownership mechanisms, implementing a bounty system to curate and reward expert contributions, and potentially adopting a DAO governance model. Although the complexity of DAOs is daunting, it offers a way for the Source platform's messaging and narrative to be co-created by a diverse group of stakeholders. If you feel called to explore this further and help shape what this might look like please get in touch.</p><p>We are also excited to announce that we will be <strong>piloting the Source platform in the ReFi ecosystem in partnership with ReFi DAO</strong>. This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to driving narrative change and promoting game-changing ideas to new audiences.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.21.15-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1114\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.21.15-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.21.15-AM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.21.15-AM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-9.21.15-AM.png 2396w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>My long-term vision for Source is to act as an engine powering narrative change, disseminating transformative ideas far and wide. From my time at Toucan, I witnessed the stigma associated with crypto and how it hampers ReFi growth and adoption. By amplifying the stories emerging from the ReFi ecosystem and breaking out of its echo chamber, we can change perceptions and foster a broader understanding of its potential. If Source can play even a small role in altering these perceptions and bringing regenerative finance to the forefront, it would be a significant achievement.</p><h3 id=\"join-the-movement\">Join The Movement</h3><p>The work we are doing at Source is more than just storytelling; it's about creating a movement. A movement that aligns with the principles of regeneration, decentralization, and empowerment. We invite you to join us on this journey, to contribute your voice, and to help us build a future where the stories we tell shape the world we want to see.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wearesource.earth/join-the-waitlist\"><u>Join the waitlist </u></a>to keep up to speed with our progress and developments.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.wearesource.earth/join-the-waitlist\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Join Waitlist</a></div>",
