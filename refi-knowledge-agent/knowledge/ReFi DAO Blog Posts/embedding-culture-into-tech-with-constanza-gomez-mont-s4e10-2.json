Constanza challenges the conventional mindset around technology, arguing that we’ve been using it to extract and control rather than regenerate. Technology, she believes, <strong>can either exploit or transform</strong>—depending on how we design and deploy it.</p><p>A key theme Constanza emphasizes is the need for<strong> cultural relevance in tech solutions</strong>. She talks about how, in Latin America, for example, where many traditional ways of life are deeply connected to the land, <strong>technology must be designed with local knowledge and context</strong>. This means rejecting the top-down, one-size-fits-all approach and instead creating systems that are built&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;communities, not&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;them.</p><p>For Constanza, regenerative systems are not only about sustainability—they’re about healing the land and empowering communities that have been <strong>left out of technological benefits</strong>. AI, machine learning, and blockchain, she argues, should be tools that reconnect communities with the land rather than extracting value from them. For example, AI can be used to create eco-friendly materials, and blockchain can track land stewardship and fairly compensate those working to restore ecosystems.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-purple\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">🤖</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"When you start to think less about efficiency of AI and </em></i><i><b><strong class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">more of what value AI is creating</strong></b></i><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">, you start to ask other type of questions.\"</em></i></div></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jb6QSvEH44o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Embedding Culture into Tech with Constanza Gomez Mont | S4E10: Regeneration Nexus\"></iframe></figure><p>Key insights from Episode 10 include... 💡</p><ul><li><strong>Rethinking technology's role</strong>: Moving from efficiency-driven, extractive models to technology that regenerates ecosystems, empowers communities, and restores balance with nature.</li><li><strong>Cultural relevance in tech</strong>: Designing technology with local communities, leveraging their knowledge, and creating solutions that address their unique needs, especially in regions like Latin America.</li><li><strong>AI and blockchain for regeneration</strong>: Using AI to create sustainable materials and blockchain to track and reward ecosystem restoration, ensuring fair compensation for those caring for the land.</li><li><strong>Overcoming barriers to transformation</strong>: Tackling challenges such as short-term financial incentives, techno-solutionism, and the industry's resistance to shifting toward long-term, regenerative goals.</li><li><strong>Tech as a tool for healing</strong>: Viewing technology not as a force of extraction but as a means to reconnect people with the land and create sustainable, community-driven systems.</li></ul><p>🎧 <strong>Tune in to Episode 10</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3AcuS6B2wQZRFKbm6DbFvp?si=b71bd21ae9e84f9e\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spotify</a></li><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/embedding-culture-into-tech-with-constanza-gomez-mont/id1609683147?i=1000678929685\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apple</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb6QSvEH44o\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YouTube</a></li></ul><p>And don’t forget!
