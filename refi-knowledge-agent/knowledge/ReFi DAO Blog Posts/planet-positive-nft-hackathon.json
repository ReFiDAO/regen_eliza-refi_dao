It was a global virtual event that focused on collaboration to address a handful of challenges set by sponsors. A total of almost 100 people participated, forming 28 teams with several participants investing time and energy in multiple teams. </p><p>You can see the overview of the event on Youtube and Notion below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CZGcqVjjwA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://planet-positive-nft-hackathon.super.site/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Planet Positive NFT Hackathon</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">April 22nd-24th, 2022, Virtual Hackathon</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://super-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99ed852f-1a3b-4965-8020-0d643365af57/images/f8f23764-4d9e-458e-9ccd-26656193b308.png\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Planet Positive NFT Hackathon</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://planet-positive-nft-hackathon.super.site/_next/image?url&#x3D;https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99ed852f-1a3b-4965-8020-0d643365af57%2Fimages%2Ff8f23764-4d9e-458e-9ccd-26656193b308.png&amp;w&#x3D;640&amp;q&#x3D;80\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><h2 id=\"arent-nfts-bad-for-the-planet\">Aren't NFTs bad for the planet?</h2><p>Many people might read this and think \"planet positive NFTs... isn't that a contradiction?\"</p><p>In short, while Proof of Work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are very energy intensive, Proof of Stake chains are incredibly energy efficient.

We'll host a series of feedback sessions between the teams and some of the judges, with workshops organized around team feedback on what would be most helpful. We will also connect teams with coaches, mentors and advisors coming from the ReFi DAO community.</p><h3 id=\"phase-3\">Phase 3</h3><p>We‚Äôll be creating a process for teams to pitch to investors to get more support in implementation and execution of ideas.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-we-learn\">What did we learn?</h2><p>If we do this again next year, we would drop the NFT aspect and just make it a ReFi hackathon, however some instances NFTs make sense but for the most part a broader set of web3 enabled tech options would widen the possibilities of what we could create.</p><p>People are very eager to collaborate in a more structured way. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive about the space to work and connect with others over these ideas.</p><p>Initially we set aside 3 days for the hackathon with one day for the actual hack. However facilitating meaningful collaboration in a disjointed global time frame meant we had to hold a vote to extend the hack by three extra days to allow for more asynchronous activities.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W-Q4lgnKGaUvbiFoh1PnF7sJZcfo-BGPWNDY3X_KnZiuudVvgDtjIefovY5aPGQKn4LpuT3hIFugchBCnPbeW4teB1hftC66i5dqKYWRjpVRW0pKSuBgNGMsjEwJmA-P2LiuHKkb_mdWXK4BPA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>At least 5 of the 28 submitted ideas were brand new ideas, most of the others had already been in formation to a degree.</p><p>To increase collaboration even further, we had to provide more structured space for teams on the Miro boards‚Äîthe challenge would be next time to create a better methodology for match making participants to teams.</p><p>To increase the diversity of participants, the choice of accessible tools (like Miro) is key.</p><h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved!</h2><p>We've love to have you in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/M5sPQS3vgu\">ReFi DAO discord</a> if you'd like to be apart of our community moving forward.
