Verra did something 😱</h1><p>Out of the blue, on May 25 Verra posted an announcement prohibiting \"the practice of creating instruments or tokens based on retired credits\". Participants at the IETA conference in Barcelona seemed to be surprised, but no one from Verra was in attendance to comment. </p><p>Over 22 million tons (5% of circulating supply) have been bridged since October 2021.

As usual, they took a very pragmatic and optimistic approach—recognizing the current architecture of tokenizing retired credits as an initial version used to bootstrap a more transparent, efficient and effective market.</p><blockquote>We’re excited that Verra has chosen to explore this path — they refer to it as an “immobilized” credit state. (We have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJg06IE4N9k&amp;ab_channel=Toucan\">previously referred</a> to it as a “tokenized” state.)</blockquote><blockquote>Introducing this designation for credits held on the Verra registry would allow for these credits to be safely transferred to another registry (like Toucan’s) without risks of double counting. Even better, connecting our registries in this way opens the door to a process where tokenized credits could be transferred back from a blockchain onto their source registry.</blockquote><p>Could this actually be a major enabling factor in the on-chain carbon market?
