  "html": "<p></p><p>The Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) Regulation is a regulatory framework for cryptoassets in the European Union (EU) that will enter into force at some point between mid-2024 and early 20251. The MiCA regulations introduce clear guidelines for handling cryptocurrencies and consumer protection, and divide crypto assets into different sectors, each subject to specific rules2. The final vote on the new regulation is scheduled for April 19, 20232, meaning the days of an unregulated crypto market in the EU may soon be over2.</p><p>According to an economist interviewed by Cointelegraph, MiCA will have a positive impact on stablecoins as it will provide a clear regulatory framework for them2. However, it is still unclear how MiCA will affect other areas of crypto such as DeFi1.</p>",
