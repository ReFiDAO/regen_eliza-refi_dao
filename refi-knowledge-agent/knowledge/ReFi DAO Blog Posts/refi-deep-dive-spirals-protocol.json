Negative ‚Äòexternalities‚Äô such as increased greenhouse gas emissions or habitat destruction are typically not accounted for at all, so our economy as it stands today struggles to properly incentivize and fund vital work being done to reverse these damaging trends.</p><p>Consequently, impactful early stage projects working to protect and restore natural capital often face significant challenges in securing financing. These same projects also face significant hurdles and delays when looking to certify their projects with<a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/refi-deep-dive-verra-standards/\"> carbon credit standards such as Verra</a>. As valuable as carbon credits are to incentivize atmospheric carbon emissions avoidance or removal, the certification process is complex, time-consuming and far from a sure thing when projects are understandably looking to launch or scale with a sense of urgency. </p><h2 id=\"the-spirals-approach\">The Spirals Approach</h2><p>Spirals Protocol aims to address these fundamental challenges by leveraging blockchain and aspects of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to incentivize investment in projects that work directly to restore and regenerate the natural environment.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey üëã We&#39;re Spirals, building a protocol to weave regenerative infrastructure directly into any proof of stake blockchain.<br><br>Any individual or DAO can choose to stake with validators running Spirals, turning their staking token balance into a climate impact funding machine! ‚õ∞Ô∏è</p>&mdash; Spirals Protocol üå±üôà (@SpiralsProtocol) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpiralsProtocol/status/1544448711983390720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><p>The project will work to fund climate projects at an early stage, typically before impact has been generated, and when they are not yet eligible for carbon credits or other dependable funding sources - filling an important gap in the climate finance space. When investing in selected projects, Spirals Protocol will receive ‚Äòforward credits‚Äô, helping selected projects launch in exchange for future carbon credits the projects may be eligible for.</p><h2 id=\"spirals-ecosystem\">Spirals Ecosystem</h2><p>Spirals primarily works through a network of validators and stakers, who directly and indirectly send a token fee to the Spirals treasury. Specifically:</p><p><em>Validators</em> - validators operating on any proof-of-stake blockchain, may choose to run the Spirals protocol, which would send a portion (undisclosed) of all of their block rewards to Spirals‚Äô treasury.</p><p><em>Stakers</em> - any individual or organization may choose to stake their PoS tokens (including CELO and cUSD) with a validator that is running Spirals, which allows them to directly support the projects Spirals is investing in. </p><p><em>Impact Projects </em>- on-the-ground regenerative projects are the direct beneficiaries of investment from Spirals, using treasury funds as directed by the Spirals community of token-holders.<br></p><h2 id=\"partners\">Partners</h2><p>Prior to launch, Spirals has established relationships with some of the key players in ReFi, including <a href=\"https://toucan.earth/\">Toucan Protocol</a> as well as high profile, upcoming projects like <a href=\"https://www.flowcarbon.com/\">Flowcarbon</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-12-at-9.51.36-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"594\" height=\"364\"><figcaption>Spirals Partners</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"tokenomics-governance\">Tokenomics &amp; Governance</h2><p>Contributors receive $SPRL, the Spirals governance token. Spirals adopts a lot of governance from <a href=\"http://curve.fi\">Curve</a><strong>; </strong>to participate, $SPRL must be locked. </p><p>Locked $SPRL allows members to propose new projects, vouch for projects in the review queue, boost project pools, and elect Climate Council members.</p><p>Spirals adds an important layer to protect the integrity and quality of climate impact projects: the Spirals Climate Council. All projects must be reviewed by this committee of multidisciplinary experts, which have a bias towards <a href=\"https://medium.com/spirals-protocol/our-approach-to-climate-impact-focus-on-causes-not-symptoms-e402582cae3a\">projects focusing on root causes, beyond symptoms. </a></p><p>ReFi projects that want to receive funding can join the review queue. The community of token holders use their $SPRL to signal support for pending projects and, once reviewed and approved by the Climate Council, use the governance token to influence the distribution of impact funds to projects in the Spirals ecosystem.</p><h2 id=\"regenerative-projects\">Regenerative Projects</h2><p>While Spirals initial investment portfolio has not yet been determined, some examples of projects the team is considering include:</p><ul><li>Seagrass Meadow Restoration (Menorca, Spain)</li><li>Bioregional Regeneration (Barichara, Colombia)</li><li>Atlantic Blue Whale Protection (Atlantic Ocean)<br></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spirals Protocol <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpiralsProtocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SpiralsProtocol</a> joins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Plastiks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Plastiks</a> to fight plastic pollution and climate change! üòÄ‚ôªÔ∏è<br><br>Spirals currently supports <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CeloOrg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CeloOrg</a> and cUSD staking, where yield is invested into impactful projects - like Plastiks!<br><br>üëâTheir profile: <a href=\"https://t.co/iQpHQK7bGW\">https://t.co/iQpHQK7bGW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/dChgDekkAn\">pic.twitter.com/dChgDekkAn</a></p>&mdash; Plastiks ‚ôªÔ∏è (@Plastiks_io) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plastiks_io/status/1567535790229422081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 7, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><h2 id=\"key-people\">Key People</h2><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenaMerk\">Helena Merk - founder</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/douglasqian\">Douglas Qian - co-founder</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/arcorren\">Alex Corren - Impact Lead</a></p><p>Aaron Price - Chief of Staff<br></p><h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.spirals.so/\">Spirals website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpiralsProtocol\">Spirals Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/spirals-protocol/what-is-spirals-protocol-30cfc9b98581\">Spirals Protocol Medium ‚ÄúWhat is Spirals Protocol?‚Äù</a></p>",
