Scaling up requires stakeholders to work towards ensuring “Interoperability” across Language, Code, and Tokens. </p><p>The two day retreat focused on specific presentations by key stakeholders around furthering “interoperability”, punctuated by Working Groups coalescing around specific initiatives.</p><p>Day 1 had presentations by</p><ul><li><strong>Dave Ford</strong> sharing his work at <strong>Ocean Plastic Leadership Network</strong> with lessons and a possible path to Interoperability with Web2 and Web3 stakeholders. Dave socialized the <strong>Blockchain for Climate Leadership Network (BxC)</strong> and invited conversations around how this could be an industry umbrella organization to enable Interoperability within Climate x Crypto and across allied domains.</li><li><strong>Philip Ackerman Leist</strong> - <strong>Foodicons</strong> - brought a <em><strong>boots on the ground</strong></em> perspective. Linking water, air, soil, carbon to climate, he galvanized the audience to think holistically around \"ecosystem benefits\" thereby highlighting the need for interoperability starting right from the ground up.</li><li><strong>Douglas Gayeton</strong> - <strong>The Lexicon</strong> -  shared the need for interoperable language that can be standardized. Bringing his experience from helping the food industry, Douglas guided the audience towards creating a “digital fingerprint” with an <strong>outcome-based regenerative model.</strong></li><li><strong>Matthew Lawrenson</strong> - <strong>Tolam Earth</strong> - emphasized the need for a credible, efficient, transparent platform for buying and selling carbon offsets at scale - a platform that’s able to cope with, Complexity of project types and methodologies, discovery and pricing of differentiated assets, and a rapid increase in demand.</li><li><strong>Francisco Benedito</strong> - <strong>Climate Trade</strong> - spoke about climate change and carbon markets facing a problem of coordination and capital allocation. He shared the work at <strong>GreenClimateDAO</strong> and <strong>Climatecoin</strong> with the aim to create a climate finance ecosystem to fund decarbonization projects.</li><li><strong>Benoît Clément - Verra-</strong>  provided insights around Verra’s <strong>openness</strong> to collaborate to make for efficient markets, drive finance to projects, and increase transparency. He highlighted the need for more positive stories of tokenization and blockchain. Questions regarding KYC surfaced several nuances around the purchase and trading of (carbon) credits.</li></ul><p><strong>Day 2</strong> of the retreat had all the participants engage with a degree of comfort, trust and desire to collaborate.</p><p>Conversations ranged across working groups, one to one’s and <strong>“out collaborating the competition”</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Gregory Landua - Regen Network -</strong> shared his vision of Regen Network as an ecosystem enabler. He cautioned against oversimplification and urged stakeholders to hold the “minimum viable complexity” as required by a holistic approach to addressing climate change. He specifically called for working with Verra as a partner rather than as a competitor.</li><li><strong>Amira Valliani - Solana -</strong> stressed the need to change the crypto narrative in Washington - to share the cases and positive stories with the policymakers. She invited the gathering to collaborate on Policy and offered to lead such work.</li><li><strong>Peter Rosberg - Ripple</strong> - shared how <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>giving back</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> is a core Ripple value that extends across a grants ecosystem and an equity investment fund focussed on Climate.</li><li><strong>Wes Geisenberger - HBAR Foundation</strong> proposed an immediately actionable item for the gathering: A common statement in response to Verra’s call for open consultation - <strong>The Medellin Statement: Response of Crypto-Climate Parties to Verra’s August 3, 2022 “</strong><a href=\"https://verra.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Verra-Public-Consultation-on-Crypto-Instruments-and-Tokens.pdf\">Public Consultation On Third-Party Crypto Instruments And Tokens</a><strong>”</strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Dave Fortson - LOA Labs -</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> shared the work being done at LOA Labs - The laboratory for better world blockchains - to be the mycelial connection across the Web2 and Web3 climate ecosystem</li><li><strong>Nirvaan Ranganathan - Climate Collective -</strong> posited that while “interoperatability is the future” - we need to address the tension between innovation (read disruption) and the need to be “interoperable”. He shared the work at Celo and Climate Collective closing with an invitation to collaborate with the gathering.</li><li><strong>Sandra Ro - GBBC</strong> - With over 600 institutional members across the globe in 95 jurisdictions GBBC is dedicated to furthering the adoption of blockchain through engaging regulators, business leaders, and global change-makers on how to harness this ground-breaking technology to create more secure, equitable, and functional societies. Sandra highlighted the urgency for the climate crypto community to scale; to take the initiative for interoperability before the regulators and statutory authorities decide the direction of this multi trillion dollar industry.</li><li><strong>Dave Ford - BxC, OPLN</strong> - spoke on “<strong>collaborative fluency</strong>” which would drive interoperability across the corporate and political domain. Dave presented the “Ark” a metaphor and an experiential journey to bring the industry, solution providers and regulators up close to the realities of global warming in Greenland.</li><li><strong>Martin Wainstein - Open Earth Foundation -</strong> shared how they leverage emerging technologies such as AI, Blockchain and IoT to enable scalable solutions at a planetary level - <em>the operating system for Planet Earth.</em> Martin emphasized on the need for “stocktake” of work done by non stake actors in the run up to the <a href=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/what-is-the-global-stocktake/\">Global Stocktake</a> concluding at COP28 in 2023 in order to co-opt state actors to ratchet up their efforts at GHG reductions. Martin also invited the gathering to help develop an integrated climate accounting system through radical collaboration.</li></ul><p><strong>Hikes, Hot Tubs, and friendships 🔥</strong></p><p>The natural setting lent itself productively to warm conversations around nature.</p><p>Highlights included:</p><ul><li>Guided hike on a 1200 year old ancestral road, built by the indigenous people and visit to the indigenous Malokas and Eco-village</li><li>Hydrotherapy (waterfall, guava self-massage, steam room, hot &amp; cold jacuzzi)</li><li>Jeffersonian-style dinners (multi-tasking: eating, drinking and plotting the future for our planet earth)</li><li>Bonfires (where we discovered hidden talents from Green Housers during spontaneous karaoke and dancing nights, including Jefferson—our favorite Colombian rapper)</li></ul><p></p><h2 id=\"5-working-groups-%F0%9F%A4%9D\">5. Working Groups  🤝</h2><p>Eight distinct working groups emerged from breakout sessions led by Chris Krohn of BxC. These working groups are focused around fundamental components that support ecologically beneficial multi-chain and multi-sector interoperability. Groups began within the categories of Social, Technical, Structural, and Ecological Benefits – from there, participants formed sub-groups around core needs.</p><p>The resulting groups are as follows:</p><p>Structural : Goal = Alignment of stakeholders, Web3 &amp; Web2 on Crypto x Climate interoperability</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"6-social-proof\">6.
