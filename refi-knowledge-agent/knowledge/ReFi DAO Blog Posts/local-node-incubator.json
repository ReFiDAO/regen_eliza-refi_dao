Recently we concluded the final session of our ‚ÄúBeta Cohort‚Äù in the Local Node Incubator program. This program brought together both aspiring and established Local Nodes to explore the theory and practice of community-based organizing around regenerative finance and systemic transformation.</p><p>Some key highlights from the cohort included:</p><ul><li>Hosting <strong>13 sessions</strong>, totaling over <strong>20 hours</strong> of instructional content and exercises.</li><li><strong>Over 100 participants</strong> attended the sessions, with more than 25 consistently tuning in each week throughout the course.</li><li><strong>More than a dozen guest speakers</strong> provided insights on topics ranging from on-chain finance to local organizing strategies.</li><li>A total of <strong>182 POAPs</strong> were minted and issued to verified attendees.</li><li><strong>18 </strong><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/0e76cf05ea894f3bba19cad59b2bb596?v=5e498d48a7824ea7817d8c7900d61e3f&amp;pvs=4\"><strong><u>Local Node Profile</u></strong></a> pages were created using our new template, including 12 for newly incubated nodes.</li></ul><p>As a result of the program, we successfully incubated a new cohort of Local Nodes to join the network.

Dive in below for a session-by-session breakdown! üëá</p><h2 id=\"session-1-uniting-for-regeneration-%F0%9F%8C%B1\">Session 1: Uniting for Regeneration üå±</h2><p>Session 1 marked the inaugural gathering aimed at exploring the essence and motivations behind the ReFi movement and its implementation at the local level. We also used 'bio cards' to facilitate introductions and allow everyone to showcase their expertise across relevant areas. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.10.18-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1098\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.10.18-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.10.18-AM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.10.18-AM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.10.18-AM.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><h2 id=\"session-2-whyworking-with-purpose\">Session 2: WHY - Working With Purpose</h2><p>The business of transforming systems is, as one might expect, complex. Our ability to create effective interventions in systems is often constrained by our understanding of what they are and what the transformative process involves. In this session, we introduced a high-level approach to systems (with a little help from the iceberg model) and that process in terms of the Why, the Who, the What, and the How.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The WHY</strong>: The purpose of the system and values-based motivations of stakeholders for engaging with it.</li><li><strong>The WHO</strong>: The many stakeholder classes and types involved in the system.</li><li><strong>The WHAT</strong>: The ‚Äúthing‚Äù in terms of the system‚Äôs design and the interfaces we provide others via an app, platform, etc.</li><li><strong>The HOW</strong>: The way we engage communities in the co-creation and the ongoing operations of the organization.</li></ul><p>This framework also served as the logic for the content across the remaining sessions in the incubator.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MC8zgWGUeQc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"‚ùìWhy, Who, What, How? | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-3-the-who\">Session 3: The WHO</h2><p>The Who is all about the stakeholders and their relationship to the system. We created a new stakeholder mapping canvas tool to help local node operators get a clearer sense of these levels of relationship; as direct participants, partners, operators, external contributors, or others with indirect interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.22.48-AM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1273\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.22.48-AM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.22.48-AM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.22.48-AM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-05-at-10.22.48-AM.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"session-4-the-whata-solution-stack-for-place-based-regeneration\">Session 4: The WHAT - A Solution Stack for Place-Based Regeneration</h2><p>Local Nodes are situated between the global, wider world of web3 and the local needs of real-world people in communities. In other words, in the space between the macro and the micro: the mezzo. This means that far from being isolated, single-issue projects, they are ideally situated to serve as aggregators of many kinds of regenerative projects and programs and as enablers of those systems in their respective local contexts. Our guest speaker in this session was Ben West, previously of Gitcoin and now Thrive Protocol. Here‚Äôs how he described the way Gitcoin also embraced a pluralistic approach by hosting multiple rounds within each round Gitcoin offers:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnRK-cA895w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"ü•û Gitcoin Grants Stack with Ben West | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><p>Scott also shared his own 5 layer framework for categorizing the various components of a place-based system. The ‚Äúcompass‚Äù layer covers legal and governance considerations; the ‚Äúcapital‚Äù layer includes financial instruments and mechanisms (like Gitcoin); the ‚Äúcommerce‚Äù layer includes marketplaces and incentives (currencies); the ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù layer includes operational elements such as the node‚Äôs own organization; and finally the ‚Äúcost-benefit‚Äù layer includes <a href=\"https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Open_Value_Accounting\"><u>open value accounting</u></a> for all of the above. </p><h2 id=\"session-5-the-what-pt-2regenerative-interventions-in-finance-and-commerce\">Session 5: The WHAT pt 2 - Regenerative Interventions in Finance and Commerce</h2><p>In this session we hosted the legendary Will Ruddick for an introduction to the world of bottom-up, community-powered, ‚Äúendogenous‚Äù finance and how bringing communities together around new financial facilities works. He shared about his work with Grassroots Economics Foundation in Kenya, and his learning journey around traditional practices of value creation and exchange there. Have a listen:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0i7AtirL7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"üå± Grassroots Economics with Will Ruddick | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><p>Reprising his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_mWaoBhAEA&amp;t=1s\"><u>2014 TEDx talk</u></a>, Scott discussed how currencies are, as his mentor and advisor <a href=\"https://bernard-lietaer.org/\"><u>Bernard Lietaer</u></a> so often put it: ‚Äúan agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange.‚Äù By creating new agreements around what's fair and valued, communities can create as many new <em>current-sees</em> as they wish. We also discussed how digital marketplaces are powerful tools for making markets based on such agreements and values-based alignment.</p><h2 id=\"session-55-bonus-sessionintro-to-hypercerts-and-minting\">Session 5.5: BONUS SESSION - Intro to Hypercerts and Minting</h2><p>As we face global challenges, the need for effective public goods funding becomes paramount. In this bonus session, we explored the innovative world of hypercerts‚Äîa cutting-edge tool poised to transform how we track, reward, and scale positive impact. Participants gained an understanding of hypercerts and got hands-on with the process of creating and minting their first hypercerts with real-world applications.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hm-YiPrwYj4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"‚ùóÔ∏èHypercerts?! | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-6-the-what-pt-3designing-for-impact-strategic-planning\">Session 6: The WHAT pt 3 - Designing for Impact: Strategic Planning</h2><p>This session aimed to deepen understanding of essential systems for community development and inspired reflection on each node's mission and vision. The session began with Juan from ReFi Medellin and Karla from ReFi Costa Rica, two of the most mature Local Nodes that, in just one year, have made some incredible progress. They presented projects such as collaborations with the army in Colombia and incubators for local impact projects in Costa Rica. Following their presentations, attendees participated in brainstorming sessions and strategic canvas mapping, connecting their initiatives to the broader ReFi movement and fostering collaboration. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoXJcSYYuvs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"üá®üá¥ ReFi Medell√≠n &amp; Glo Dollar | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-65-bonus-session%E2%80%9Cit%E2%80%99s-raining-grants-in-web3%E2%80%9Dan-overview-and-brainstorm-of-opportunities\">Session 6.5: BONUS SESSION - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Raining Grants in Web3‚Äù - An Overview and Brainstorm of Opportunities</h2><p>In this bonus session, we explored a variety of current grant and fundraising opportunities for ReFi projects. We covered key programs such as Gitcoin Grants, Giveth's quadratic funding rounds, Optimism's RPGF and Cele Public Goods. The session concluded with a collaborative brainstorming to identify additional grant opportunities to benefit ecosystem projects, fostering innovation and collaboration.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E3OkRmnfyI4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"üî¥ 850M for Public Goods | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7cHXtn0Vyw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"üü° Celo Public Goods | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-7-the-how-pt-1co-creating-strategy-via-collaborative-engagement-with-multi-stakeholder-coalitions\">Session 7: The HOW pt 1 - Co-creating Strategy via Collaborative Engagement with Multi-stakeholder Coalitions&nbsp;</h2><p>Moving from the What into the How, we were joined by Sage Gibbons of <a href=\"https://prosocial.world\"><u>Prosocial.World</u></a> and turned our focus towards specific approaches and strategies for developing regenerative community systems with the communities for whom they are intended. Especially when we‚Äôre coming from a place of techno-optimism, where so much of ‚Äúthe solution‚Äù is technologically oriented, it is important to appreciate the value of bringing people together, creating new and deeper relationships between them, and inviting them into contexts where they can express their local context-informed needs and values in constructive ways that may inform future efforts and product development.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4L0-IwWNw0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"üß† Conscious Cultural Evolution with Sage Gibbons | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-8-the-how-pt-2practical-considerations-for-building-purpose-led-local-networks-innovations-in-on-chain-finance\">Session 8: The HOW pt 2 - Practical Considerations for Building Purpose-led Local Networks + Innovations in On-chain Finance</h2><p>This session focused on the role that local currency and credit systems can play in re-circularizing the local economy and building up a sense of shared community identity. We were joined by Chris Hewitt of the <a href=\"https://hudsonvalleycurrent.org\"><u>Hudson Valley Current</u></a> who shared about his journey from working in local print media to local currency and how opening up Tilda‚Äôs Kitchen, a cafe in upstate New York, has provided invaluable opportunities to build community, solidarity, and interest in joining the network of locals and businesses accepting Currents.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XwfeLLEhrY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"üí∑ Local Currency in Hudson Valley with Chris Hewitt | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-9-the-how-pt-3leadership-operations-conflict-management-with-gravity-dao-and-timothe%C3%A9\">Session 9: The HOW pt 3 - Leadership, Operations &amp; Conflict Management with Gravity DAO and Timothe√©</h2><p>We wrapped up the core content with a session more focused on the internal side of things. First we were joined by Juan from Gravity DAO, who shared their work creating a distributed conflict mediation service and the process they use in navigating conflicts. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-NsVxLC7jE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"ü§∫ Conflict Resolution with Juan Bell of Gravity DAO  | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><p>We were also joined by Timothe√© of <a href=\"https://timotheebrs.medium.com/the-androgynous-organisation-part-2-media-action-ffd53f6359f7\"><u>The Androgynous Organisation</u></a> (T.A.O.). He shared about the primal energies we bring into organizations through our own cultural and personal values, as well as the art of balancing leadership and followership, centralisation and decentralisation, crucial for scaling DAOs while aligning with core values and fostering a culture of care and radical innovation. As it happens, ReFi DAO recently voted on an MVP proposal for its own structure and governance which incorporates these values and approaches to working together.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTZJZQ6VqHc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"‚òØÔ∏è Centralised &amp; Decentralised with Timothe√© Bres  | ReFi Local Node Incubator\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"session-10-finalebeta-cohort-celebration-closing-ceremony\">Session 10: Finale - Beta Cohort Celebration &amp; Closing Ceremony</h2><p>Our final session took us on a reflective journey not so different from this summary, and provided an opportunity for a number of local node organizers to take the stage to share more about how they‚Äôre planning to move forward in their respective local communities.
