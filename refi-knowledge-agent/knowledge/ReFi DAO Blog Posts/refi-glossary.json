These decentralized ledgers, when correctly integrated, could also enable us to visualize and track the nestedness of systems, understanding how local actions can have national or global ripple effects in an environmental and social context. </p><p><strong><strong>NFT’s</strong></strong> could provide a container for the data of a regenerative project, tracking social, environmental, and economic data within a specific bio-region or other area that defines a whole*system. NFT’s could represent the wholeness of places by organizing all data around one token, unifying our analysis of the place and restoring it to it’s true state. Think of an NFT that represents a bio-region, and the different natural, cultural, and economic systems that support the bioregion are represented as data streams within the NFT. Now we have all the relevant information in one place, facilitating the interdisciplinary understanding of a place’s wholeness that’s necessary for regenerative work. NFT’s could be “linked” to the bio-regional NFT to show their nestedness within the whole of the bio-region.
