This involves exploring various models such as advisory services, partnerships with regenerative initiatives, and identifying reliable sources of funding for ongoing work.</li><li><strong>Community Building and Governance Structures</strong>: Strengthening the community by building a robust network of contributors, and implementing effective governance models, such as reputation weight governance, is essential. This includes ensuring radical transparency and decentralization in decision-making processes.</li><li><strong>Local Node Empowerment and Support</strong>: Activating and supporting local nodes with value-aligned frameworks and technology is vital. This could involve local economy enablement, community currency initiatives, and offering consistent support to local nodes.</li><li><strong>Event Organization and Global Engagement</strong>: Organizing global ReFi events, retreats, and workshops will foster community engagement and knowledge sharing. These events should focus on best practices for node governance, innovation in ReFi, and global collaboration.</li><li><strong>Innovation in Digital Platforms</strong>: Developing innovative digital tools and platforms, such as a ReFi hiring platform, token exchange or a Local Node NFT Minter, will facilitate talent acquisition, community referrals, and creative collaborations within the network.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Sharing and Synergy Creation</strong>: Building out a knowledge graph and creating synergies with networks like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/regensunite\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Regens Unite</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greenpillnet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Greenpill Network</a> will enhance the efficiency and impact of the community‚Äôs initiatives. This includes avoiding duplication of efforts and learning from each other.</li><li><strong>Addressing Cultural and Perception Challenges</strong>: Addressing the public perception problem of crypto and integrating real-life projects with technology solutions will be key. This includes bridging the gap between tech-heavy solutions and trust in real-life impact projects.</li><li><strong>Focus on Local and Global Impact Balance</strong>: Balancing initiatives that have both local and global impact, ensuring that local nodes are empowered while contributing to a global decentralized network, is important for the holistic growth of ReFi DAO.</li></ol><p>Additionally, as proposed and developed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thetokenjedi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Scott Morris</a>, we plan to utilise the Co-Production Canvas as an organizational mapping tool for visualising value flows and recognizing contributions through a profit-sharing system. By integrating collaborators, offerings, community, and accounts, the Canvas holds potential to envision a comprehensive, equitable, and collaborative approach to ReFi DAO's future operations.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-10.40.09-am.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1780\" height=\"1786\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-10.40.09-am.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-10.40.09-am.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-10.40.09-am.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-10.40.09-am.png 1780w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Canvas developed by Scott Morris and originated from Zebras Unite cooperative patronage system</span></figcaption></figure><p>In summary, the strategic focus for ReFi DAO in 2024 will be on formalizing as a DAO, developing global collaboration platforms, creating sustainable revenue models, strengthening community and governance, supporting local nodes, organizing impactful events, innovating with digital tools, managing strategic partnerships, and working together to build a regenerative future.</p><hr><h1 id=\"come-join\">Come join!</h1><p>In order to help achieve these ambitious targets and initiatives we have formed an initial working group of global contributors to help facilitate key operations and drive the further DAOification of ReFi DAO in 2024. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-3.17.51-pm.png\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1259\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-3.17.51-pm.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-3.17.51-pm.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-3.17.51-pm.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-15-at-3.17.51-pm.png 2062w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-4.48.23-pm.png\" width=\"1836\" height=\"1542\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-4.48.23-pm.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-4.48.23-pm.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-4.48.23-pm.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-4.48.23-pm.png 1836w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div></figure><p>As we embrace this new chapter for ReFi DAO your input and involvement is key!
