It's an exciting time to be a part of the #ReFi movement - if you're interested to learn more about ReFi, get involved in the movement, or have a story you want included in the newsletter, reach out to us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiDAOist\">@ReFiDAOist</a>!</p><hr><h2 id=\"toucans-nature-carbon-pool-goes-live\"><strong>Toucan's Nature Carbon Pool goes live</strong></h2><p>Following the announcement of the Nature Carbon Pool last week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToucanProtocol\">Toucan</a> officially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToucanProtocol/status/1491826836476608512?s=20&amp;t=pOUhq4vpRIxS94b-Mk-YvA\">went live with its NCT token</a> on Thursday. Details on the inclusion criteria for the pool were released earlier in the week: credits have to come from nature-based methodologies with vintages from 2012 onwards. <br><br>The creation of the new pool was driven by the need to differentiate between the quality of carbon credit projects. Nature-based credits can be viewed as the 'best-of-the-best' of carbon credits as they offer additional environmental benefits aside from emissions reductions, like habitat regeneration. This results in nature-based credits trading at a premium on the market, something that wasn't previously reflected in Toucan's BCT pool, which accepted all credits as long as they were Verra registered.</p><p>The new NCT pool will further drive carbon market price transparency and the creation of new high quality projects.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://blog.toucan.earth/announcing-nct-nature-carbon-tonne/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">NCT: a nature-based carbon token on Toucan Protocol</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Introducing Nature Carbon Tonne (NCT): Web3’s first open, pooled, nature-based carbon reference token.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://blog.toucan.earth/favicon.png\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Toucan Protocol</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Ela Khodai</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://blog.toucan.earth/content/images/2022/02/Twitter_Image.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id=\"sovereign-nature-initiative-winter-hackathon-winners-announced\"><strong>Sovereign Nature Initiative Winter Hackathon winners announced</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sovereignnature\">Sovereign Nature Initiative</a> works to accelerate the use of new technologies like AI and blockchain toward sustainability.

On Friday, WWF UK said they would close the project and <em>\"<a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/nft-statement\">fully assess the impact of this trial and reflect on how we can best continue to innovate to engage our supporters</a>\".</em></p><p>This serves as an important reminder that while there is incredible momentum behind the ReFi movement, there is still a lot of work to be done.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/02/02/wwf-uk-faces-backlash-plan-sell-nfts-fund-conservation-work/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">WWF-UK faces backlash over plan to sell NFTs to fund conservation work</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">On Twitter, WWF donors threatened to cancel their subscriptions, accusing the nature charity of greenwashing Ethereum and Bitcoin</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/assets/img/favicon.png\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Climate Home News</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Chloé Farand</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://cdn.climatechangenews.com/files/2022/02/02172503/panda.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id=\"mossearth-announces-governance-token-project\"><strong>Moss.earth announces Governance Token Project</strong></h2><p>Following up on their Series A raise and a sold out NFT project (<a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/refi-roundup-feb-4/\">see ReFi Roundup #3</a>), <a href=\"https://moss.earth/\">Moss.earth</a> announced plans for a Moss governance token.</p><p>Like most other governance tokens, the Moss Token will allow holders to participate in discussions on the management and direction of Moss and vote on changes to the MCO2 protocol.
