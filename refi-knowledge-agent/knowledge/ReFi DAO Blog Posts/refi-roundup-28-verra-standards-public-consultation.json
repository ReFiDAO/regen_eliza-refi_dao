A common practice before Verra halted the tokenization of its VCUs was to move the credits on-chain via a modified \"retirement\" process. Verra has stated that it prefers an \"immobilized\" status instead, as the \"retired\" status was intended to be the end of a VCUs life-cycle, not the beginning of a new on-chain life-cycle.<br><br>Additionally, Verra has requested comment on the process of KYC (know your customer). Currently, all accountholders in the Verra Registry are required to comply with KYC checks. Verra requests comment on the scope of KYC checks, how these checks should be conducted, and what information should be made available public. These issues cut to the core of Web3 ethos, which has traditionally favored decentralization and anonymity.<br><br>The consultation process will conclude on Sunday, 2 October 2022, at 11:59 pm Eastern time. A consultation webinar is tentatively scheduled for T<strong>uesday, 30 August 2022, 11 am- 1230pm</strong>. Registration details will be available on the Verra website www.verra.org.</p><h2 id=\"klima-dao-and-indentdefi-partner-to-develop-a-kyc-solution-for-onchain-carbon-markets\">Klima DAO and IndentDefi Partner to Develop a KYC Solution for Onchain Carbon Markets. </h2><p>Klima DAO is no stranger to navigating the challenges of tokenizing VCUs and melding the often disparate worlds of DeFi and TradFi. Holding over 15 million tokenized VCUs from Verra in its treasury, <a href=\"KlimaDAO and IdentDeFi Announce Partnership to Develop a KYC Solution for On-Chain Carbon Market\">Klima DAO is trying to get ahead of the challenges of Verra's KYC goals by partnering with IdentDefi to embed a KYC function into the tokens themselves</a> (necessity is the mother of invention, indeed!).<br><br>As an example, a Base carbon Tonne (BCT) would become BCT.safe. A transaction of these tokens would be possible only if the buyer and seller were adequately KYC'd. This is a creative new conceptual model. The question is will Verra see this new approach as inline with its goals? Additionally, will investors also be willing to go through the KYC process to trade tokenized carbon credits? </p><h2 id=\"celo-connect-salon-in-paris\"><br>Celo Connect Salon in Paris</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"875\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/image-4.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/image-4.png 875w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Celo, a layer 1 blockchain protocol, has positioned itself to become one of the homes of ReFi.

Many of us in this space think fast, talk fast, and build fast. We feel our efforts aren't a choice, but a necessity. If we don't find a solution to the looming climate catastrophe, who will? Many of us have felt this pressure, and many of us sacrifice an awful lot of our time and energy to contribute to the space.<br><br>Remember that the Re in ReFi stands for regenerative. Make sure YOU are regenerating your energy levels and your passion. While many of us feel as though we needed solutions yesterday, the reality is we are limited at times by things beyond our control.<br><br>Nothing exemplifies this more than the Verra freeze on tokenization of carbon credits that took the ReFi space largely by surprise. To many of us it felt like a gut punch or a death knell signaling the undoing of all the hard work that had been gamely fought for by the regens. We were on a roll, and now we're fighting an incumbent carbon registry for our right to tokenize carbon credits so we can keep building open, transparent, efficient market places.<br><br>It can be stressful. Roadblocks in any domain can cause stress, but delays in building solutions to impending crises add another layer of worry. Regardless, we push forward. But we have to take stock of how we push and at what pace. What is realistic to expect? What are the costs of pushing too hard/too fast, especially when what we're pushing against doesn't seem to be in any hurry to budge?<br><br>I recommend we all take a deep breath, remind ourselves that the collective passion and drive of the ReFi community will never be stymied, and organize ourselves and our resources to meet the challenge ahead. Let's meet; let's talk; let's listen; let's recharge; let's be creative; let's be pragmatic; let's accept the limitations of what we control; let's continue making progress. </p><p>Let's make sure that we allow ourselves time to breathe and enjoy the experiences of life. We will make it.<br><br>ReFi, like our lives, moves in one direction: <em>forward</em>. </p><hr><h2 id=\"thank-you-to-slaptain-from-this-week-in-refi-%F0%9F%91%8F\">Thank you to Slaptain from This Week in ReFi! üëè</h2><p>If you enjoyed this article, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/slaptainshwirv\">This Week in ReFi</a>!
