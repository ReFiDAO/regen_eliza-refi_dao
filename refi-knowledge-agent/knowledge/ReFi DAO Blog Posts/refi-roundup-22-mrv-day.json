We're having so much fun in ReFi, it's sometimes easy to forget that the planet is on fire and governments are doing squat about it.</p><p>But then you start digging into the relationship between on-chain transactions and on-the-ground regeneration and you realize the world is in a bad place‚Äîeven when you're working from home. Our oceans are filled with plastic, our forests are being destroyed, and our surface temperature is rising at an alarming rate.</p><p>Fortunately, there's a whole host of brilliant people who have devoted their lives to scaling climate action using scientifically proven methodologies with publicly verifiable evidence. Thank goodness. I was about to lose hope. </p><h1 id=\"mrv-a-regenerative-economy\">MRV &amp; A Regenerative Economy</h1><p>MRV is the primary mechanism by which a new kind of economic system is emerging that incentivizes actors around the world to perform planet positive behaviors that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be economically feasible. There are dozens of different methods, but the primary actions can grouped into a few simple categories:</p><ol><li>Using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels</li><li>Reforesting degraded land</li><li>Preventing deforestation</li><li>Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</li></ol><p>Pick any of these categories and you‚Äôll find a collection of <em>specific behaviors</em> people do that supposedly have a positive impact. MRV is the system of tools and processes that attempts to reward:</p><ol><li>People that <em>actually do</em> this target behavior</li><li>Target behaviors that <em>actually</em> have a positive impact</li></ol><h2 id=\"making-sense-of-mrv\">Making sense of MRV</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/image-10.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/image-10.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/image-10.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2022/06/image-10.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2022/06/image-10.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Adapted by Sev from Peter Olivier's ReFi for Project Developers</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who is in the space has heard the phrase \"MRV\" which stands for \"Measurement, Reporting and Verification\". But what does it actually mean? How does it actually work?</p><p>There is a process that occurs to ensure that a buyer of a particular asset is getting what the seller has promised to them. In most cases, they're buying climate action and PR to make up for destroying the planet in some form or another. This action usually is encapsulated in a carbon credit.</p><p>Given carbon credits are entirely made-up commodities (no one can deliver carbon to your door, it's just a fictional asset constructed by lawyers, a buyer and a seller), we need systems in place in order to justify the expense of buying something that is very abstract and sometimes intangible.</p><p>These systems are currently fulfilled by organizations like Verra and Gold Standard who have worked tirelessly for decades before carbon was cool. The current models rely on a small amount of people flying around the world with a checklist and a measuring tape stretched around the diameter of trees.</p><p>This obviously doesn't scale, and time is running out. So technologists are looking at using a variety of technologies to enable large-scale regeneration to take place with verifiable proof. That way big corporates who have made audacious net zero commitments can pave the way to realize their goals. As any project developer knows, buyers want evidence to justify these costs.</p><h2 id=\"sampling-remote-sensors-drones-and-satellites\">Sampling, remote sensors, drones and satellites</h2><p>Given people flying around the world isn't a scalable solution to verify planetary regeneration, technologists have brought a host of tools to enable a new generation of MRV that stacks layers of data to make an informed view on whether key behaviors are occurring.</p><p>Come join us in the MRV Museum to dig into how this works, who is doing what where and what newcomers are entering the space. We'll host guided tours from today at 10.30 PST to June 26th, then will publish a series of content to help other people make sense of what we learned.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://discord.com/events/932199180150145055/988877428527075398\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Join a Guided Tour of the MRV Museum</a></div><p>If you miss the live guided tours, you can also wander around the Museum on your own after the opening day.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-dark\" style=\"\" data-kg-background-image=\"\"><h2 class=\"kg-header-card-header\" id=\"refi-bites\">ReFi Bites</h2><h3 class=\"kg-header-card-subheader\" id=\"the-best-of-refi-twitter-and-beyond\">The best of ReFi Twitter and beyond...</h3></div><h2 id=\"refi-comes-to-tedx-bristol\">ReFi comes to TEDx Bristol</h2><p>Check out our friend Monty's amazing TEDx talk taking ReFi to the masses...</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-4HW3iPtfo?start=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Can crypto regenerate the world? | Monty Bryant | TEDxUniversityofBristol\"></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"refi-nyc-frens-enjoying-the-rooftops\">ReFi NYC frens enjoying the rooftops</h2><p>I hope I'm not the only one WFH today feeling serious FOMO.

The risk of ReFi being co-opted by Venture Capitalists and greedy green washy TradFi is very real, as are the continuation of exploitation under Green Capitalism and Green Colonialism at large. In reaction, we propose a vigilant and uneasy truce with big capital mainly in order to retain access to funding that accelerates the transition, without forgetting who should be in charge - sovereign local communities and their Commons.‚Äù</blockquote><hr><h2 id=\"is-it-refi-summer-already\">Is it ReFi Summer already?</h2><p>Celo used the solstice as an excuse to kick off ReFi Summer‚Äîwhich is a great meme and something we're very much looking forward to... but is it ReFi Summer already?</p><p>Our take is that scaleable dMRV needs to be in place in order for us to see a proper bull run across ReFi that takes regenerative cryptoeconomic systems into the mainstream.
