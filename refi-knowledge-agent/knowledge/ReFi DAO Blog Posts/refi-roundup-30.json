Science Act</a></strong>.  Signed into law last week (August 9, 2022), the act designates $68 billion over next 5 years for zero carbon technologies &amp; climate adaptation.<br><br>2. <strong><a href=\"https://earth.org/inflation-reduction-act/\">The Inflation Reduction Act</a></strong>.  Signed into law Tuesday (August 16, 2022), the act includes a $369 billion investment in energy security and climate change over the next 10 years.<br><br>Combined with last year's Infrastructure Investment &amp; Jobs Act, that’s around <strong>$80 billion per year</strong> on accelerating the development and deployment of climate-positive technology and adaptation infrastructure.  Together these acts represent the largest investment to address global warming in U.S. history. 👏</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/A--500B-Investment-in-a-Green-Economy-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/A--500B-Investment-in-a-Green-Economy-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/A--500B-Investment-in-a-Green-Economy-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>As far as Regenerative Finance is concerned, these governmental rebates and subsidies will spur massive innovation and adoption of several key areas in which ReFi is involved including:<br><br>🌄 Renewable Energy and Storage<br>🌐 Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Technology<br>🚄 Energy Efficient Transportation<br>🏭 Decarbonization Industrial Manufacturing<br>🚜 Regenerative Agriculture<br><br>There are even substantial earmarks for forestry management, soil health, along with watershed protection and restoration.  Plus all of this emphasis and attention on reducing environmental impact will undoubtedly invigorate the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) in the coming years.  The development of digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) will likely prove to be a critical component in the assessment and documentation of environmental outcomes for the individuals, businesses, and industries which these acts affect.<br><br>Considering the long and winding road to the passing of these two acts, this week feels like a monumental turning point in the conversation and action around climate change.  ReFi is developing at exactly the right moment in time to be a catalyst for positive planetary transformation.</p><hr><h2 id=\"refi-jobs-%E2%80%9C11-ventures-and-investors-funding-the-future-of-regenerative-finance%E2%80%9D\">ReFi Jobs: “11 Ventures and Investors Funding the Future of Regenerative Finance”</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://refijobs.com/blog/regenerative-finance-investors\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/11-Ventures-and-Investors.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/11-Ventures-and-Investors.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/11-Ventures-and-Investors.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>On <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/refi-roundup-28-verra-standards-public-consultation/\">ReFi Roundup #28</a> we highlighted the launch of <a href=\"https://refijobs.com/\">ReFiJobs.com</a>, an actively updated job board connecting talent to careers in Regenerative Finance.  In just two weeks the platform has grown, with 26 current job listings from over twenty ReFi companies.<br><br>This week, ReFi Jobs released an article outlining <strong>11 climate-focused technology funds</strong> and grant programs channeling capital towards a more sustainable and regenerative future.  Grant from ReFi Jobs also provided a clear call to action for others to contribute to the list to make it comprehensive.  Read more about each of the highlighted organizations in the link below:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://refijobs.com/blog/regenerative-finance-investors\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">ReFi Jobs | 11 Ventures and Investors Funding the Future of Regenerative Finance</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">In order for us to see significant growth in regenerative finance and agriculture the industry needs investment and risk takers to be integrated in the broader ReFi eco-system.
