Rising global temperatures and increasingly erratic weather patterns are leading to more frequent and severe natural disasters, affecting food security, water resources, and public health. Plastic pollution exacerbates the effects of climate change by contributing to flooding, harming wildlife, and posing significant health risks to communities. Due to&nbsp;growing urbanization and increasing usage of plastics, managing these synthetic materials has become a global challenge. The breakdown of these larger plastic items into microplastics further complicates the issue, as these tiny particles can be ingested by marine and terrestrial animals, eventually finding their way into human food and water supplies.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#introduction\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">Globally, over 450 million tons of plastic waste are generated each year.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"989\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-8.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/image-8.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-8.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.globalplasticaction.org/nigeria\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nigeria</a> is no exception.

Nigeria ranks ninth among countries with the highest contributions to plastic pollution, producing over 2.5 million tons of plastic waste annually. Unfortunately, more than 88% of plastic waste created in Nigeria is not recycled. The most prevalent single-use plastics we encounter daily are food and beverage packaging.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#introduction\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"></a></p><h2 id=\"environmental-and-health-impacts-of-plastic-waste\">Environmental and Health Impacts of Plastic Waste</h2><p>Landfills are often overlooked, representing more than mere heaps of rubbish; they are major sources of harmful gases that exacerbate climate change. Daily, tons of household waste are deposited into landfills. Within these sites, a variety of discarded food, plastics, and other debris undergo a decomposition process that releases gases. According to a World Bank report, solid waste management accounted for approximately<a href=\"https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/trends_in_solid_waste_management.html\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\"><u>&nbsp;</u>five percent of global emissions<u>&nbsp;</u></a>with methane emission being a key contributor, While the majority of oceanic plastic waste originates from land-based activities, an estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rts.com/blog/plastic-pollution-in-the-ocean-facts-and-statistics/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">75 to 199 million tons<u>&nbsp;</u></a> are already present in marine environments. Studies suggest that tourist activities are the primary source of microplastics on most beaches in Lagos, Nigeria.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-10-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-10-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-10-1.png 640w\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://punchng.com/waste-management-and-flood-control-in-lagos/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Punchng.com</span></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"problem-worth-solving-indiscriminate-waste-disposal\"><strong>Problem Worth Solving: Indiscriminate Waste Disposal</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@ThistlePraxis/igniting-waste-management-culture-in-nigeria-738d279c3fc8\" rel=\"noopener\">Improper waste disposal</a>&nbsp;is a significant issue in Nigerian cities, impacting public health, the environment, and urban aesthetics. Despite efforts to manage waste, several challenges hinder effective waste handling. One of the primary challenges is the inadequate waste management infrastructure. Many cities in Nigeria lack sufficient facilities for proper waste collection, recycling, and disposal, leading to waste being discarded illegally in open spaces, waterways, and streets. Coupled with this is the issue of insufficient funding. Waste management systems are frequently underfunded, restricting the state's capacity to effectively fight illegal dumping and preserve cleanliness.  A significant factor that also contributes to illegal dumping is the lack of public awareness about its environmental and health impacts. Education and awareness campaigns are not widespread or effective enough to change public behavior. As a result, many individuals end up burning their waste thereby releasing harmful pollutants into the air, contributing to air pollution and posing serious health risks to residents, especially children and the elderly.</p><p>Addressing these challenges involves investing in modern waste management facilities, promoting public-private partnerships, and exploring decentralised climate solutions.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a href=\"https://x.com/Afrilearn1/status/1802731892191412259\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-11-1-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-11-1-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-11-1-1.png 700w\"></a><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source:</span><a href=\"https://x.com/Afrilearn1/status/1802731892191412259\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> AfriLearn1 X spaces</span></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-rise-of-circular-and-regenerative-economy\"><strong>The Rise of Circular and Regenerative Economy</strong></h2><p>For decades, our global economy followed a linear trajectory, extracting raw materials, producing goods, and disposing of them once their usefulness has expired. This linear approach, while fostering economic growth, led to mountains of waste and the depletion of finite resources. A circular economy envisions a regenerative cycle where resources are used, reused, and regenerated. It promotes designing products for longevity, repairing and refurbishing, recycling materials, and ultimately reducing waste.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/image-12.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"290\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Source: </span><a href=\"https://www.repsol.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-pillars/environment/circular-economy/index.cshtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Repsol</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Innovations have emerged as pivotal solutions to address the growing challenge of plastic waste. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.plastiks.io/\"><u>Plastiks</u></a>, a Web3 initiative, offers a reward system that ensures plastic waste is properly recovered and recycled.
