I got my start back in 2009 by organizing a community currency pilot in the wake of the \"Great Financial Crisis\". I was mighty honored to be in the film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2949308/\">Money &amp; Life</a> for that work alongside some real ReFi OG's; folks like <a href=\"https://capitalinstitute.org/\">John Fullerton</a>, <a href=\"https://charleseisenstein.org/\">Charles Eisenstein</a>, <a href=\"https://centerforpartnership.org/\">Riane Eisler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ethicalmarkets.com/\">Hazel Henderson</a>, and <a href=\"https://bernard-lietaer.org/\">Bernard Lietaer</a>. These days I offer regenerative economic systems design expertise and a seasoned operator's perspective to teams, funders, and policy makers on what community based systems can do with crypto and what it takes to implement. </em></p><p><em>In this edition of the Roundup, we talk about the still unfolding banking crisis, the IPCC report, and the usual array of goodies.

What boomers call a \"once in a lifetime\" crisis is basically just <em>Tuesday</em> for millennials and younger generations. Many of us have already reached the point of \"just throw it on the crisis pile.\" 🤷‍♂️</p><p>Last week we saw an escalation in the latest financial crisis, after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/072dd83d-232d-4223-9428-801d4437b4f6\">Swiss bank Credit Suisse</a> went down following the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail\">Silicon Valley Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-15/signature-bank-faced-criminal-probe-ahead-of-firm-s-collapse\">Signature Bank</a> in the US.

For all we hear about how risky crypto is, it sure feels like the old system flies into panic mode <em>somewhere </em>at least every 2-3 years. Our dearly departed monetary and economic philosopher, and co-architect of the European Currency Unit (predecessor to the Euro), <a href=\"https://bernard-lietaer.org/\">Bernard Lietaer</a> loved to remind people that we have actually experienced <em>hundreds</em> of financial, banking, and debt crises since the 1970's. </p><p>But what are we to do? Return to the gold standard? Hardly. Bernard had a <a href=\"https://bernard-lietaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2010-Is-Our-Monetary-Structure-a-Systemic-Cause-for-Financial-Instability-Evidence-and-Remedies-from-Nature-Lietaer-et-al-annotated.pdf\">different recommendation</a>, which was to diversify our economical systems so they were in line with the way nature designed ecological systems: as a balance of streamlining for efficiency with diversity and interconnectedness for resilience. </p><p>In other words, instead of striving for a hyper-connected, uber-liquid monetary and financial <em>monoculture</em>, what we really need is to create an economic <em>permaculture</em>, one with ample alternatives and redundancies so that when the shocks come (and they will continue to) real people in real communities can rest easier knowing they will still be able to meet local needs with local resources. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-24-at-4.36.34-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"587\" height=\"298\"></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://bernard-lietaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2010-Is-Our-Monetary-Structure-a-Systemic-Cause-for-Financial-Instability-Evidence-and-Remedies-from-Nature-Lietaer-et-al-annotated.pdf\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Read Bernard&#x27;s article here</a></div><h3 id=\"empowering-communities-through-alternative-economics-%F0%9F%AB%B6%F0%9F%8F%BC\">Empowering Communities Through Alternative Economics 🫶🏼</h3><p>It is in these moments of crisis and uncertainty that we gain the sharpest sense of how urgently and how badly these alternatives are needed, especially by those <em>not</em> working with substantial amounts of financial capital. </p><p>That's where we come in Regens. ReFi is really but the latest chapter of a long tradition of native, informal, alternative, complementary, feminist, emancipatory, solidarity, and syntropic economics arising to fill the gaps and reprioritize the health and wealth of the planet and her people. </p><p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OL5xyoD_P6A?t=3910\">What does that look like</a>? It looks like a <em>full spectrum</em> of monetary and financial mechanisms, and any number of the technologies that provide access and use of the same, working <em>together</em> in service of a post-extractive, pro-regeneration way of being for humanity on the planet. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Spectrum-of-Monetary-Systems.001.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/Spectrum-of-Monetary-Systems.001.jpeg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/Spectrum-of-Monetary-Systems.001.jpeg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/03/Spectrum-of-Monetary-Systems.001.jpeg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Spectrum-of-Monetary-Systems.001.jpeg 1680w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>an improved version of a slide from my TEDx: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v_mWaoBhAEA\">Putting People and Planet Before Paper Wealth</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, I have drawn deep inspiration from stories I've heard of people overcoming incredibly challenging conditions by rethinking how money works in relationship to what \"value\" means in their community:</p><ul><li>Stories like that of the <a href=\"https://tontinecoffeehouse.com/2020/06/15/silvio-gesell-and-the-worgl-experiment/\">Austrian Worgl</a>, where a local mayor issued local notes to stimulate the local economy during the Great Depression which were so effective people reportedly had enough extra cash to start prepaying their taxes. </li><li>Like that of the distributed regional <a href=\"https://bancopalmas.com/\">Banco Palmas</a> system in Brazil, whereby local farmers and rural communities gained access to credit systems and other financial services powered by regionally devoted currencies, each with their own local flavour.</li><li>And like those of the more <a href=\"https://www.moneyland.ch/en/time-banking-currency-switzerland-guide\">recent introduction</a> of a time-based currency &amp; approach to saving for retirement in Switzerland, where they have already had time to cultivate a famously stable economy in part due to the now 80+ year old <a href=\"https://monneta.org/en/wir-bank-switzerland/\">WIR bank</a> and its business to business mutual credit system.</li></ul><p>Over time, it becomes clear that the tools we're building and the technologies involved matter much less than the relationships rooted in real community and the process by which the community is included in the process of determining what is actually needed based on their specific set of challenges. Each of the above examples provide a glimpse at the power of what's possible when this is done well. </p><p>Good luck, and may the Force be with you always. 💪</p><hr><div class=\"kg-card kg-header-card kg-width-full kg-size-small kg-style-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://blog.refidao.com/content/images/2023/02/ReFi-Cover-1.png)\" data-kg-background-image=\"https://blog.refidao.com/content/images/2023/02/ReFi-Cover-1.png\"><h2 class=\"kg-header-card-header\" id=\"refi-newsbites-%F0%9F%97%9E%EF%B8%8F\">ReFi NewsBites 🗞️</h2><h3 class=\"kg-header-card-subheader\" id=\"em-stylebox-sizing-border-boxthe-latest-updates-across-refi-twitter-and-beyondem\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">The latest updates across ReFi Twitter and beyond...</em></h3></div><h2 id=\"ipcc-publishes-synthesis-report-%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F\"><strong>IPCC Publishes Synthesis Report ☁️</strong></h2><p>The good news: The world is not <em>completely</em> doomed!
