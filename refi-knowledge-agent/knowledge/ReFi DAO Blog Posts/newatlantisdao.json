Healthy marine ecosystems are vital to the overall health of our planet, as they:</p><ul><li>Produce 50% of the world’s oxygen;</li><li>Form the basis for the global food web;</li><li>Provide an estimated US$29.5 trillion/year in marine ecosystem services; and</li><li>Are critical to the ocean’s ability to sequester carbon.</li></ul><p>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one of the leading ways to preserve and protect global marine biodiversity.  Unfortunately, they often lack the resources and financial self-reliance to adequately protect life in their waters due to their dependence on sporadic government funding and philanthropy. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U24KODxubVI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"ReFi Podcast S2E15: Ocean Metagenomics with Courtney and Gordon from New Atlantis DAO\"></iframe><figcaption>ReFi Podcast S2E15: New Atlantis DAO</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"new-atlantis-approach\">New Atlantis' Approach</h2><p>New Atlantis is an ocean regeneration project that provides Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with a viable business model by making marine biodiversity (and life-driven blue carbon) an investable asset class.  They aim to achieve this by launching a<strong> </strong>marine biodiversity analytics platform that will empower MPAs with the data they need to generate blue carbon and biodiversity credits. This process creates a sustainable revenue model that scales as MPAs expand their conservation efforts.</p><h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2><p>Learn more and dive in to get involved in New Atlantis DAO:</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlantis.io/\">New Atlantis Website</a></p><p><a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/grants/7126/ne\">New Atlantis Blue Paper via Gitcoin</a></p><p><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/newatlantis\">New Atlantis Discord</a></p><p><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/newatlantisdao\">New Atlantis Twitter</a></p>",
