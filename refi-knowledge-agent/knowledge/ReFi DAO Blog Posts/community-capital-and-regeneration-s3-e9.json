He has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ament/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maex Ament</a> on numerous ventures, and together they are now exploring the ReFi space.

Society places a heavy burden on us with its expectations and structures, but those who have managed to step outside the typical path, find themselves with less to unlearn as they move into self-organized systems. </p><p>These systems, which value agency and collaborative decision-making, allow individuals to fluidly pick up leadership roles when they can lead and follow when it feels right to do so. This contrasts sharply with hierarchical systems, where responsibility and authority are concentrated at the top, and individuals often find themselves waiting for approval and following orders without question. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1367\" height=\"603\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/image.png 1367w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.greaterthan.works/\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">https://www.greaterthan.works/</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Community--Capital-and-Regeneration-with-Philip-Stehlik-and-Lena-Bumke-Season-3-Episode-9-e2bdp8g\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/refipodcast/episodes/Community--Capital-and-Regeneration-with-Philip-Stehlik-and-Lena-Bumke-Season-3-Episode-9-e2bdp8g\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen 🎧</a></div><h3 id=\"a-journey-to-meaningful-living-%F0%9F%8C%84\">A Journey to Meaningful Living 🌄</h3><p>One of the biggest lessons Philip learned as he stepped out of the startup space and into a more communal way of living and working was the importance of taking the time to build strong, trust-based relationships. In the startup world, everything is about moving fast and getting results quickly. But when you're living and working in close proximity with other people, you need to take the time to truly understand each other and build a foundation of trust.</p><p>In the startup world, it's easy to get caught up in the rush and excitement of creating something new. But if you don't take the time to step back and reflect, it's easy to lose sight of what's truly important. By stepping out of the startup space and into a more communal way of living, Philip was able to find a better balance between work and life. He was able to slow down and appreciate the small moments, and this has made a big difference in his overall happiness and well-being. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkjr1Xb7ngM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Community, Capital and Regeneration with Philip Stehlik and Lena Bumke │Season 3 Episode 9 🎧\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Zkjr1Xb7ngM\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch 📺</a></div><p><strong>This episode covers:</strong></p><p>[00:00:00] Teaser<br>[00:00:39] Introduction<br>[00:02:49] Lena’s Personal Journey<br>[00:07:25] Who is Philip Stehlik?<br>[00:12:41] Building Regenerative Organizational Systems<br>[00:16:06] Taking a Break From the Treadmill<br>[00:19:18] Community Building Between Life And Work<br>[00:24:50] Organizations Dealing With People’s Wounds and Traumas<br>[00:29:50] Inner Regeneration And Working On Regenerative Systems<br>[00:38:10] Tough Times For ReFi&nbsp;<br>[00:41:15] What’s Coming Next?<br>[00:33:20] Money: The Primary Coordination Vehicle<br>[00:44:15] Is the Venture Capital Model Fit For ReFi?<br>[00:55:21] Pieces of Advice for Early-Stage Founders<br>[00:59:03] The Future Is Now</p><h3 id=\"join-the-conversation-%F0%9F%92%9A\">Join The Conversation 💚</h3><p>We're eager to gather insights from all of you as we delve into the future of our planet and investigate the multitude of methods we can employ to instigate change at this very moment. </p><p>Engage with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiPodcast\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/refi-dao/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>, or connect with a local <a href=\"https://www.refidao.com/community/local\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ReFi community</a>!</p><p>If this episode resonated with you, we'd be grateful if you could leave us <a href=\"https://podcast.refidao.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a five-star review on your preferred podcast platform</a>!
