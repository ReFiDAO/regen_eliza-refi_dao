The value locked within its vast agricultural real estate remains untapped, while the delicate balance of biodiversity is threatened by climate change. In this article, </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eze-simon/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Simon</em></a><em> explores the transformative potential of Web3 and regenerative finance in addressing these challenges while promoting agricultural real estate and delving into risks and considerations. </em></p><p><em>Let's dive in 👇</em></p><h1 id=\"introduction-unveiling-the-challenge-and-opportunity-%F0%9F%91%A5\"><strong>Introduction: Unveiling The Challenge And Opportunity 👥&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>The <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/home/en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">UN Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO) estimates that more than <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/sustainability/success-stories/detail/en/c/1296568/\"><u>half of the world's agricultural land is degraded</u></a>.&nbsp; This threatens global food security and results in <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/why-empowering-100-million-farmers-to-transform-our-food-systems-matters/\"><u>$400 billion in annual productivity losses</u></a>. Agriculture, which today is responsible for approximately <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-023-02159-3\"><u>one-third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</u></a>, may hold the key to mitigating and adjusting to climate change. Smallholder farmers, especially those in the global south, are essential to accelerating the world's transition to net-zero emissions.&nbsp;</p><p>Agriculture in Africa has been a promising area, employing more Africans than other sectors. With <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/how-africa-can-feed-the-world/\"><u>60% of the world's uncultivated arable land</u></a>, agriculture accounts for <a href=\"https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/africa-focus-summer-2023-africas-agricultural-revolution\"><u>35% of Africa's GDP</u></a>. Despite contributing to the economy, agricultural land in Africa faces many challenges. These include poor land tenure systems, governance, limited financing, and climate change. These restrictions have impeded the growth of agricultural real estate and increased food imports.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>Imagine Mama Nkechi, a smallholder farmer in Abia, cultivating her 2-acre farmland. Her dreams of expanding her farming operations were thwarted by the harsh reality of financial exclusion. Traditional banks claim her farm is too small and her earnings are too unstable to justify investment.</em> However, within this paradox lies a revolutionary seed -<strong> a vision powered by the potent synergy of Web3 and regenerative finance (ReFi). </strong></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/66DOR5nymPBQ4J_C0pxBx2QGmq9BYt7xs5km925YU3b085lzDLjHC8T_6teFjsNDARpT7atIDzce8kEEMSewLehASw0Q63MwgkGnLEA172PG67BBi0yDFTqxiWHUqzCdz_OrDnAIzMiKyeBN7OSWIko\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1240\" height=\"756\"></figure><hr><h2 id=\"exploring-nature-as-an-asset-class-tokenized-real-estate-%F0%9F%94%93\"><strong>Exploring&nbsp; Nature As An Asset Class: Tokenized Real Estate 🔓</strong></h2><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/e-agriculture/news/farmdrive-improves-access-credit-smallholder-farmers\"><u>FAO data</u></a>, over 90% of smallholder farmers in Africa lack access to formal credit, limiting their investment in agricultural land and food production. This has resulted in rural-urban migration, talent flight (<a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/590035-japa-syndrome-talent-flight-as-the-real-cost-of-corruption-in-nigeria-by-agbo-ochonu-kperogi.html\"><u>japa</u></a>), and dead assets.&nbsp; A PwC <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/publications/bringing-dead-capital-to-life.html\"><u>report</u></a> estimates that Nigeria alone has residential real estate and agricultural land valued at least $300 billion in <a href=\"https://businessday.ng/news/article/nigerias-asset-register-slowly-takes-shape-with-70-entities-captured/\"><u>dead assets</u></a>. The country has over <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/nigeria/fao-in-nigeria/nigeria-at-a-glance/en/\"><u>35 million hectares of arable land</u></a> with just 40% of it being used.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-tokenization\"><u>tokenization</u></a>- the process of issuing digital representations of physical assets on a blockchain, is changing the global investment landscape. The Boston Consulting Group estimates that tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) could <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenization-of-illiquid-assets-to-reach-16t-by-2030-report\"><u>become a $16 trillion industry in the coming years</u></a>.

By 2030, <a href=\"https://www.afdb.org/en/cop25/climate-change-africa\"><u>Africa would require investments totaling more than $3 trillion in climate mitigation and adaptation</u></a> to carry out its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. However, existing funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation programs in the region is substantially below this prediction.&nbsp;</p><p>With a growing population of 1.4 billion, Africa’s food market is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Scaling sustainable food production requires alternative funding sources, and Web3 technology has created a wide range of financial opportunities and protocols, including ReFi.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><a href=\"https://blog.toucan.earth/what-is-refi-regenerative-finance/\"><em><u>Regenerative Finance (ReFi)</u></em></a><em>, a blockchain-powered impact financial system built on regenerative principles, emerges to help </em><a href=\"https://www.protokol.com/insights/what-is-regenerative-finance/\"><em><u>reverse the effects of industrialization and systemic financial imbalance</u></em></a><em>. </em></blockquote><p>ReFi emphasizes the active contribution of financial systems to people and nature, aligning seamlessly with the need to preserve biodiversity and cultivate sustainable investments.&nbsp; &nbsp;The current estimated market size for <a href=\"https://thegiin.org/research/publication/impact-investing-market-size-2022/\"><u>impact investing sits at $1.164 trillion globally</u></a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ziCKxWZ1BFX-VLPnpcl72maxlAHNf071Hb281aYoW5Bn2qqTF7hatjm_fBzwBbseyfcGiQGJHP-_uSbsC71qvVwTAbjjKtypECVdlaXUMtFMW8VkixQIA2oI4hB8nPdznd8N6KP7oa8p3VXoSHBaUCk\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"842\" height=\"489\"></figure><h3 id=\"%F0%9F%8C%BB-how-it-works\"><strong>🌻 How It Works</strong></h3><p>Natural capital-backed assets are an innovative and unique approach to valuing and safeguarding nature.
