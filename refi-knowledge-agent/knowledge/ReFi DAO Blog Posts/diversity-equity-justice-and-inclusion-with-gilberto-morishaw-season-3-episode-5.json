Gilberto's roots in Curaçao and his life in Amsterdam have painted his worldviews with unique shades, providing him with rich insights into regeneration from a holistic perspective.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/refipodcast/episodes/Diversity--Equity--Justice-and-Inclusion-with-Gilberto-Morishaw-Season-3-Episode-5-e2a2hor\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen on Spotify 🎧</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Diversity--Equity--Justice-and-Inclusion-with-Gilberto-Morishaw-Season-3-Episode-5-e2a2hor\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><p>Gilberto shares his viewpoint on the work Kolektivo is doing in Curaçao. Born and raised on this beautiful island, he provides us with an insider’s perspective, presenting a vivid picture of the on-ground realities and challenges in Curaçao. Through his eyes, we explore the true essence of regeneration as Kolektivo sees it— a process entangled with the lives and roles of the people in the community.</p><p>What are we all working towards? What does the end state of our collective regeneration mission look like? These are complex questions, and our dialogue with Gilberto attempts to shed light on these. The conversation is a tapestry of thoughts, ideas, and visions about the future we are building, the purpose driving our actions, and the destination we envision for our communities and the Earth.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;53qWdM2HQHY\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch 📺</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/53qWdM2HQHY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Diversity, Equity, Justice and Inclusion with Gilberto Morishaw │Season 3 Episode 5 🎧\"></iframe></figure><p><strong>This episode covers:</strong></p><ul><li>02:21 Meditation and alignment</li><li>06:25 Building regenerative communities</li><li>11:04 Tokenization and regenerative systems</li><li>14:24 Justice, equity, diversity, inclusion</li><li>19:57 Diversity and innovation in economics</li><li>22:39 Going fast, not going deep</li><li>26:10 Urgency and doom in climate crisis</li><li>29:59 Conservation and indigenous stewardship</li><li>34:43 Dancing with the devil in capitalism</li><li>38:53 Web3 and public verifiable impact</li><li>42:24 Redefining wealth</li><li>45:18 Transitioning economic systems for equity</li><li>48:15 Overcoming comfort for future growth</li><li>52:07 Holding yourself in love</li><li>56:25 Lack of end state</li><li>59:03 Mainstreaming blockchain technology</li><li>01:03:20 Inclusion and regeneration</li><li>01:06:19 The world is changing</li></ul><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/refipodcast/episodes/Diversity--Equity--Justice-and-Inclusion-with-Gilberto-Morishaw-Season-3-Episode-5-e2a2hor\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen on Spotify 🎧</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Diversity--Equity--Justice-and-Inclusion-with-Gilberto-Morishaw-Season-3-Episode-5-e2a2hor\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"join-the-conversation-%F0%9F%8C%9F\">Join the Conversation 🌟</h2><p>We await your thoughts and feedback on this episode.
