The Brazilian federal government have launched a compliance market framework which is a momentous step as they've previously been dismissive.</p><blockquote>Eliminating a large source of uncertainty for Brazilian project REDD+ credits is key for international investors to put money to work in the country for the expansion of supply and for us to create economic incentives for the conservation of Brazilian forests.</blockquote><p>Though our good friend Marcelo Silva, Community Manager at ReFi Spring commented:</p><blockquote>It’s very serious for people fighting for climate justice. We've just seen the death of the two regens here in Brazil.</blockquote><p>Dom Philips a British journalist was <a href=\"https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/amp/internacional/en/brazil/2022/06/journalist-dom-phillips-murdered-at-age-57-loved-brazil-and-the-amazon.shtml\">murdered</a> along with an indigenous activist Bruno Pereira while trying to protect native folks and the forest from illegal miners. Bruno was a Brazilian civil employee who was fired by the government after applying penalties for criminals linked to Bolsonaro. Sadly we hear of corruption on all levels when conservation is at play - something that those looking to have an impact have to contend with regularly.</p><hr><h2 id=\"state-of-dmrv-roundtable-tickets-go-live\">State of dMRV Roundtable tickets go live!</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/dmrv-roundtable-event.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"969\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/dmrv-roundtable-event.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/dmrv-roundtable-event.jpg 969w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The kick-off event for the inaugural MRV Day has free and paid tickets available on ReFi Spring.
