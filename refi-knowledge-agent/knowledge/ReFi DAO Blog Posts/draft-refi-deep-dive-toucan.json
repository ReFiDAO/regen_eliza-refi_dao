  "html": "<h2 id=\"tldr\"><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2><p>Toucan is a web3 regenerative finance (ReFi) protocol, focused on bringing carbon credits (primarily from the Verra registry) on-chain and making them readily accessible for emerging blockchain-powered carbon markets.</p><p>Toucan launched alongside fellow ReFi protocol KlimaDAO, in October, 2021, providing the initial pool of carbon credits branded as Base Carbon Tonne (BCT), which Klima utilized as backing for their token. Since launch, over ___ carbon tonnes have been bridged on-chain by Toucan, ___ % as BCT and ___% as their Nature-Based Carbon Tonne (NCT).</p><p>Similar to other bridges and ReFi projects working on building on-chain demand for carbon credits, Toucan's activity was immediately and severely limited once Verra announced the suspension of all bridging of carbon credits via their registry in May, 2022. As of August, 2022, Verra has launched a two-month consultation phase, seeking input from the public and key stakeholders to explore and address their concerns around the rapidly-developing on-chain markets.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenge\"><strong>The Challenge</strong></h2><p></p><h2 id=\"toucans-solution\"><strong>Toucan's Solution</strong></h2><p>Creating BCT and NCT pools allows for fungibility of these new tokens, while the underlying carbon credits on their own have varying vintages, methodologies and geographic provenance that make them difficult to source, trade or offset in bulk. </p><h2 id=\"state-of-the-on-chain-vcm\"><strong>State of the On-Chain VCM</strong></h2><p></p><h2 id=\"toucans-partners-and\"><strong>Toucan's Partners and </strong></h2><p></p><h2 id=\"resources\"><strong>Resources</strong></h2>",
