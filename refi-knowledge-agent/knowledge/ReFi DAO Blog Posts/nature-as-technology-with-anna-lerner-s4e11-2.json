Drawing from her roles at the World Bank and Meta, Anna offers insights into the systemic challenges and opportunities within climate finance and technology.</p><p>Anna highlights that a <strong>significant portion of global climate finance remains tied to subsidies that harm ecosystems </strong>or comes with restrictive conditions, limiting its effectiveness. “We need to rethink how funding flows—redirecting harmful subsidies and designing mechanisms that prioritize measurable outcomes,” she says. She points to blockchain-backed biodiversity credits, such as those developed by Region Network and Terrasos, as a way to ensure verifiable conservation impacts through<strong> transparent, immutable data systems.</strong></p><p>While these innovations show promise, she<strong> critiques the broader industry’s reliance on technological solutions that often overlook local realities</strong>. She emphasizes that systems must integrate<strong> cultural relevance and governance structures</strong> to succeed. AI, she explains, holds great potential for scaling climate action, particularly in providing real-time monitoring of deforestation and ecosystem health. However, she stresses that these tools should enhance, not replace, local stewardship. </p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-purple\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">🤝</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">There’s so much</em></i><i><b><strong class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> techno-enthusiasm </strong></b></i><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">where people go into communities thinking they have the solution, </em></i><i><b><strong class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">but they lack understanding </strong></b></i><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">of governance structures or how to safely manage data related to indigenous or local communities. </em></i></div></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCT-undpnqU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Nature as Technology with Anna Lerner | S4E11: Regeneration Nexus\"></iframe></figure><p>Key insights from Episode 11 include... 💡</p><ul><li><strong>Fixing accountability at COP summits:</strong> Anna critiques the lack of follow-through at COP summits, calling for systems like blockchain to track climate pledges, ensure transparency, and drive measurable outcomes.</li><li><strong>Biodiversity credit markets for restoration:</strong> Emerging markets backed by blockchain are enabling industries to invest in nature-based solutions, bridging the gap between corporate commitments and tangible ecosystem restoration efforts.</li><li><strong>Blockchain-powered climate equity:</strong> Initiatives like Savimbo are using blockchain to create transparent payment systems for Indigenous communities, ensuring fair compensation for ecosystem restoration and addressing barriers like exclusion from formal banking systems.</li><li><strong>Indigenous-led innovation in technology:</strong> Collaborative efforts focus on integrating traditional ecological knowledge into technological solutions while ensuring data sovereignty and non-exploitative practices, setting new ethical standards.</li><li><strong>AI for measurable conservation:</strong> Projects like GainForest leverage AI, drones, and satellite imagery to provide real-time data on biodiversity and forest health, enabling actionable insights and scalable solutions for conservation.</li></ul><p>🎧 <strong>Tune in to Episode 11</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6vuAx0w26V2jZCUV3ZOVrl\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spotify</a></li><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/refi-podcast/id1609683147?i=1000679769431\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apple</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCT-undpnqU\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YouTube</a></li></ul><p>And don’t forget!
