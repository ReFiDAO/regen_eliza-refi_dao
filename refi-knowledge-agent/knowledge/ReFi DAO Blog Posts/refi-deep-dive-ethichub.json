  "html": "<h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>Based in Madrid, Spain, <a href=\"https://www.ethichub.com/\">EthicHub</a> is a social impact investing platform, leveraging blockchain technology and crowdfunding mechanics to provide small-scale farmers with the financing required to bring their products to market, and for their enterprises and communities to thrive.</p><p>The project operates globally, with over 300 current projects successfully funded to date via microloans managed by blockchain-powered smart contracts.</p><h2 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h2><p>Around the world, farmers with smaller operations struggle to access financing needed to reach their potential. This can put barriers in the way to getting products to relevant regional and international markets, as well as to maintaining and growing their offerings over time. Further, small-scale farmers in some markets like North America </p><p>Income inequality, poverty, food security and hunger are all serious consequences of this lack of of access to financial capital. </p><h2 id=\"ethic-hubs-approach\">Ethic Hub's Approach</h2><p><em>Focus on Coffee </em>- Ethic hub is focused on farmers producing coffee, primarily in Mexico and Brazil (NEED TO DIG DEEPER)...</p><p><em>P2P Crowdlending</em> - EthicHub allows individuals to make direct loans to coffee under-banked producers who are facing challenges accessing capital. Specific producers, with defined project needs are listed in a <a href=\"https://app.ethichub.com/projects\">public database</a>. Project backers receive pre-determined interest on their loans, managed by smart contracts.</p><p><em>Leveraging Blockchain</em> - While a cryptocurrency wallet isn't necessary to engage with the EthicHub platform, by enabling cryptocurrency payments for micro-loans expands the pool of capital that producers have access to. Fast, traceable and safe transactions enabled by blockchain bring increased inclusion and impact to the platform. EthicHub is partnered with Rootstock (RSK), a Bitcoin-operated P2P smart contract platform. </p><p><em>Ethic Hub and SDGs</em></p><p>The approach employed by Ethic Hub allows the project to address a total of 9 of the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-5.14.43-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1004\" height=\"1030\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-5.14.43-PM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-5.14.43-PM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-5.14.43-PM.png 1004w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">SDGs addressed by Ethic Hub</span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XTBYMfZyrM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Do you know all 17 SDGs?\"></iframe></figure><p><em>Big Lenders Program </em> - In addition to its core microloan crowdfunding platowrm, Ethic Hub also offers a 'Big Lender' program that was launched in response to demand from their crowdfunding community. Participation in this program gives larger investors more flexibility in when they may invest.</p><p><em>Ethic Hub Local Nodes</em> - In Ethic Hub's model, local nodes are individuals who represent Ethic Hub and discover local small-scale producers who would likely benefit from participating in the fundraising platform. Having a local individual on the ground in these regions personalizes what could otherwise be seen as strictly a technological solution, and ensures that the work of the farmers and local community meets environmental standards, improving both quality and output.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-27-at-9.48.37-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"724\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-27-at-9.48.37-PM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-27-at-9.48.37-PM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-27-at-9.48.37-PM.png 1066w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Example of EthicHub Local Node Profile</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Ethic Hub Coffee </em>- In addition to supporting farmers through microlending, you can also buy coffee direct through Ethic Hub's website, available as either beans or ground.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://shop.ethichub.com/en/collections/cafes-de-especialidad-de-ethichub\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Buy Ethic Hub Coffee</a></div><h2 id=\"tokenomics\">Tokenomics</h2><p><em>Ethix Token </em>- EthicHub employs Decentralized Finance (DeFi) mechanisms through its $ETHIX token, which they refer to as a 'confidence-backed token'.
