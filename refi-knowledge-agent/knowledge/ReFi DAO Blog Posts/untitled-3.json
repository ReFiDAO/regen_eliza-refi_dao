For thousands of years, people have been carving symbols and messages into tree bark as a means of marking territory or conveying messages. For example, <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-native-americans-bend-these-trees-to-mark-trails\">Native American tribes in North America</a> often used tree carvings to mark trails, signal danger, or indicate where food could be found. It's fascinating how we've always been so connected to nature!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/05/image-42.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/image-42.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/05/image-42.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A marker tree (Source: <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-native-americans-bend-these-trees-to-mark-trails\">Atlas Obscura</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Now, by using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), we're elevating this connection by combining technology with nature.</p><p>NFPs combine real plants 🌿 and digital NFTs 🖼️ to create a new format for data storage that is literally carbon-absorbing.

For thousands of years, symbols and messages were carved into tree bark as a means of marking territory or conveying messages. With the introduction of the modern digital technologies, this ancient practice has been lost of course. But now, connecting the digital and natural worlds, an exciting innovation look set to revive this connection in a surprising way...</p><h2 id=\"the-problem-of-big-data\">The problem of BIG data</h2><p>The exponential growth of digital data is one of the defining features of the modern era with vast amounts of information being created, stored, and shared every day. However, this growth is not without consequences, particularly when it comes to the environment. The ongoing energy consumption required to power this data-driven world is substantial, and it is increasing at an alarming rate. Additionally, the hardware infrastructure required to store and process all of this data has a significant impact on the environment, with the production of electronic devices and their disposal contributing to pollution and e-waste. As our reliance on digital technologies continues to grow, it is essential to find sustainable solutions to mitigate their impact on the environment and ensure a sustainable future.</p><h2 id=\"introducing-non-fungible-plants\">Introducing Non Fungible Plants</h2><p><a href=\"https://growyourown.cloud/\">Grow Your Own Cloud</a> (GYOC) is an exciting new green biotech company developing new clean data solutions utilising DNA data storage through plants!</p><p> is leading the way!
