They are an innovative project launching soon, looking to fuel the renewable energy transition we need to address the climate crisis and deliver a sustainable future. </p><p><a href=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast\">ReFi Podcast</a> hosts John and Simar sat down with Reneum co-founder Brianna for a hugely insightful and inspiring conversation about her work at Reneum, which will soon launch a green marketplace that will use the power of Web3 and blockchain to fund renewable energy. She shares the background story, future prospects and also the bigger picture of Renewable Energy Certificates and the role they can play in the needed transition to green energy, and so much more...</p><h2 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h2><p>Our climate crisis is intimately tied to our current prevailing modes of energy production. Likewise, our financial systems are incentivized to continue funding GHG-intensive energy production and other activities, while externalizing or under-valuing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>To reach the emissions targets put forward in the UNâ€™s Paris Agreement, annual global clean energy investment must increase seven-fold from less than $150 billion in 2020 to more than $1 trillion per year by 2030.</p><p>Although science has shown us not only what's at risk and what must be done, many markets havenâ€™t yet turned off the flow of investment toward fossil fuels. High upfront capital costs for renewables, combined with regulations and subsidie that favour fossil fuels make doubling down on the status quo attractive for investors.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IEA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IEA</a> published its eagerly awaited World Energy Outlook 2022.
