Luiz is an impact entrepreneur, big wave surfer, and co-founder of Cambiatus and Play4Change. <br><br>In this article, we delve into Brazil's ReFi ecosystem, examining its unique niches and significance within the global ReFi landscape. 🌿</p><h2 id=\"setting-the-scene\">Setting the Scene</h2><p>As the heart of the Amazon rainforest and the country with the largest water reserves, Brazil is known as the <a href=\"https://iucngreenlist.org/country/brazil/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">world's most biodiverse country</a>. But as it strives to protect its natural assets, it navigates challenges related to economic growth, illegal mining, and external pressures on its oil reserves. </p><p>In short, Brazil's vital role in global ecological preservation confronts a dichotomy: <strong>safeguarding the environment versus addressing its citizens' needs</strong>, especially when global support comes with strings attached.</p><p>This dilemma has made Brazil a fertile ground for innovation. The civil society, the private sector, and the government all take turns in proposing novel solutions. This is also one of the reasons Brazil has become a fintech powerhouse boasting thousands of startups. As <a href=\"https://camilarioja.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mila Rioja</a> (Celo Foundation Lead for Latam) put it, the country is truly a \"maverick\". </p><p>So, what does this mean for web3, and specifically for the ReFi ecosystem? Web3 is a movement centered on services, products, and communities rooted in blockchain technology. Within this realm, ReFi (Regenerative Finance) bridges climate action and decentralized finance. But, as the co-author, <a href=\"https://thatsgnar.ly/luizhadad\"><strong>Luiz Hadad</strong></a>, points out at every opportunity, the emphasis on climate and finance is a typically Global North view. We have the right to approach regeneration through our unique lens. </p><p>The Venezuelan ReFi advocate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuaNex\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Susana González</a> shares a <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/roundup-60/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">similar sentiment</a>: \"It is essential to recognize the Global South's unique challenges and leverage its people to build the foundations of independence.\" So, in search of what ReFi means for us in Brazil, let's look at some key actors and the problems they're trying to solve.</p><h2 id=\"the-four-pillars-of-the-brazilian-refi-ecosystem\">The Four Pillars of the Brazilian ReFi Ecosystem</h2><p>Brazilian initiatives within or in alignment with ReFi can primarily be categorized into four niches:</p><ul><li>🎉  Events and communities (as discussed in our <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/the-brazilian-ecosystem-of-regenerative-finance-pt-i/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">previous article</a>)</li><li>💼  Established financial entities and companies</li><li>🚀  Emerging startups</li><li>🌟  Noteworthy projects</li></ul><p>This time, we'll be diving into the latter three. In the ReFi sector, Moss and AmbiFy are standout players, bridging the gap between traditional markets and web3. Moss actually became the first Brazilian entity to list a tokenized carbon credit globally. Meanwhile, AmbiFy steadily navigates its path deeper into the web3 space. Additionally, while aligning with ReFi values, the Amaz Fund and Gaia Group are yet to integrate blockchain into their operations. </p><p>Let's explore them all in greater detail. 👇</p><h2 id=\"moss\">Moss</h2><p><a href=\"https://moss.earth/pt-BR\"><strong>Moss</strong></a> first came into existence as a trading and brokerage company that achieved the authorization to do business within APX and IHS Markit (both later bought by Verra) in 2020. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/image_share.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image_share.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image_share.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/image_share.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/image_share.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>After extensive research, Moss became the first Brazilian company to list a tokenized carbon credit.

Yet, in spite of the dispute, Moss remains the first major Brazilian firm to sell tokenized carbon credits.

And although this approach is a key way to address global social changes, it's important to remember that other perspectives exist. Sometimes, as said by one of the most efficient social entrepreneurs in Rio de Janeiro, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/osvaldin_the_cryator_iltda/\"><strong>Osvaldinho</strong></a><strong> (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/studiokrya/\"><strong>Studio Krya</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/2050_____/\"><strong>2050</strong></a>)</strong>, “It is not about development, but involvement.” 🤝</p><p>When building new solutions, it's thus crucial to consider their implications and the power dynamics they foster. Many Brazilian initiatives recognize this, pushing past the narrow carbon-centric view and harnessing web3 for local social impact.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/photo_2023-10-02-15.24.44.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"707\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/photo_2023-10-02-15.24.44.jpeg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/photo_2023-10-02-15.24.44.jpeg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/photo_2023-10-02-15.24.44.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The original picture is part of the article about </span><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ecological-benefits-activator/\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Ecological Benefits.</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>In the ReFi ecosystem, this isn't a side note or \"almost ReFi.\" It's about healing something as vital as nature in Brazil: <strong>the social fabric</strong>.</p><p>The country still grapples with profound social issues from colonization's legacy.
