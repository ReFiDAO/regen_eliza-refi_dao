There are risks that need to be managed however, in relation to speculative tokenization schemes and uncertain regulatory environments.<br></li><li><strong>Digital MRV:</strong> The deployment of digital technologies in monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) can increase market efficiency, accuracy and transparency. These advances need uniform standards to ensure that they enhance robustness and do not undermine integrity in place of efficiency.<br></li><li><strong>Data repositories: </strong>Blockchain technology can enable data repositories such as the World Bank’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.theclimatewarehouse.org/work/climate-warehouse\">Climate Warehouse</a>, which aspires to link all carbon credit issuing authorities and registries under one platform. This creates much needed transparency on the status and location of carbon credits and helps avoid the double counting of credits.</li></ul><p>For a brief, tweetable overview checkout <a href=\"https://twitter.com/climateXcrypto\">John Ellison's</a> TL;DR summary 👇</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://typefully.com/climateXcrypto/0xhpjgL\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">IETA Council Task Group on digital climate markets – Key findings TL;DR | 🇺🇦 John Ellison 🇺🇦</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">@IETA’s task group for digital carbon markets released a statement via @CarbonPulse.
