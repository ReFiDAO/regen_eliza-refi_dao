Read on to learn more about this exciting regenerative finance project.</p><h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>Kolektivo is an ambitious regenerative finance project founded in 2021, working to reboot and re-tool our economic systems to build a more sustainable future. With founders from <a href=\"https://www.curvelabs.eu/\">Curve Labs</a>, Kolektivo is planning to soft-launch their MVP (minimum viable product) in October, 2022 on the <a href=\"https://celo.org/\">Celo blockchain network</a>. ¬†</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3wOu2Lt9XU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"ReFi Podcast S2E9: Kolektivo Framework with Luuk and Pat\"></iframe><figcaption>Kolektivo on ReFi Podcast</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h2><p>Traditional economic models have handed us the overlapping climate, ecological and social crises that we face today. While there has certainly been <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/43/4/444/1666627?redirectedFrom=PDF\">large-scale natural resource exploitation in the past</a>, the most recent century and a half of global, industrial-powered capitalism have amplified and accelerated the negative impacts beyond what we can collectively sustain. </p><p>Our sheer human numbers and the technology at our collective disposal has meant that pursuing 'progress' as defined by our prevailing economic systems has come at an enormous, unaccounted environmental cost. Not only do our current economic and financial models turn a blind eye to environmental impacts like the <a href=\"https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/\">steady upward march of atmospheric CO2</a>, they can even incentivize the destruction of our natural world. Consider for a moment that through the myopic economic analysis lens of GDP, environmental disasters like oil spills can be seen as great for the economy when cleanup efforts create more jobs and spending than the initial spill might have disrupted. Hooray? Clearly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window#Cost_of_disasters\">something's wrong here</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To solve the 21st-century challenges, we need regeneration at an institutional scale! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ReFi</a> <br><br>Kolektivo allows local communities to launch, finance, and govern their regenerative economies.<br><br>Find out how in our fresh dropped Bluepaperüëá<a href=\"https://t.co/3Lb1o5eJDK\">https://t.co/3Lb1o5eJDK</a></p>&mdash; Kolektivo (@Kolektivo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kolektivo/status/1572218269167222790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 20, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><h2 id=\"kolektivos-approach\">Kolektivo's Approach</h2><p>Drawing close inspiration from the ideas and ideals of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics\">ecological economics</a>, Kolektivo aims to spur environmental regeneration through novel financial mechanisms. Fundamentally, this requires re-centering and placing our social and economic systems as dependent upon or subservient to a sustainable, vibrant environmental sphere. This is in sharp contrast to the types of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics\">'neoclassical' economic</a> models discussed above.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-26-at-7.24.57-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"536\" height=\"394\"><figcaption>Ecological Economics' Nested Systems</figcaption></figure><p>Kolektivo aim to empower local communities to create prosperity for themselves following the principles of ecological economics, backed by local community currencies. To launch their initiative, the team has been hard at work in Cura√ßao to build a local economy that is able to provide a sustainable social foundation for its citizens, while minimizing the negative ecological impact.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ReFi</a> is not just a meme, it is actually our best chance at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/regenerating?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#regenerating</a> earth and creating prosperity.<br><br>7 months ago this was a dry, empty plot of land.

As such, the project consists of multiple distinct components, which work in tandem to fairly and efficiently gather and allocate resources to regenerative projects. At the core of this approach will be a web3-powered community currency that enables the near-instant, secure, and transparent transfer of value.</p><p><em>Kolektivo Framework</em></p><p>The Kolektivo framework represents the composable, modular underlying web3 technologies that empower the development of the local currencies that support and incentivize the protection and regeneration of ecosystems.</p><p>Some of these technologies include <a href=\"https://symmetric.finance/\">Symmetric</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.fxcm.com/markets/insights/automated-market-makers/\">automated market-maker</a> on Celo; <a href=\"https://oceanprotocol.com/\">Ocean Protocol</a> is a decentralized platform for data markets, that will be used to support Kolektivo's ecological state tokens; and <a href=\"https://deals.prime.xyz/\">Prime Deals</a>, which facilitates DAO-to-DAO negotiations that Kolektivo will leverage to connect their various local currency project reserves, treasures and environmental stewardship organizations.</p><p><em>Kolektivo Network</em></p><p>The Kolektivo Network is a coalition of innovators, impact funders, and environmental stewards, which is raising $11.25M via a Kolektivo Nature Token (KNT) offering. This initial raise is being framed as a \"seed of seeds\", as it will be used to not only launch their initial Cura√ßao local regenerative currency, but also build momentum for subsequent community currency launches.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-26-at-8.53.33-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1952\" height=\"1026\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-26-at-8.53.33-PM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-26-at-8.53.33-PM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-26-at-8.53.33-PM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-26-at-8.53.33-PM.png 1952w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Kolektivo's Current Network of Builders and Partners</figcaption></figure><p><em>Natural Capital Tokenomics</em></p><p>Kolektivo proposes to reflect the value of natural capital and ecosystem services provided by the natural world through tokenization - which will in turn incentivize the ongoing and continued protection of those same resources and ecosystems. While the project remains in development, these tokens could include: </p><ul><li><strong><strong>Natural Capital Tokens</strong></strong>: A token indicating ownership of some natural capital or ecosystem asset, such as land or yields produced by land. An example could be a food forest in Cura√ßao, with a token representing ownership of the produced fruit yields year after year.</li><li><strong><strong>Ecological State Tokens</strong></strong>: These types of tokens are a type of <a href=\"https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-1-data-custody-1d0d5ae66d0c\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\">data token</a>. They contain data concerning the state of the ecosystem they represent. For example, the <em><em>Posidonia Oceanica</em></em> ‚Äî a popular seagrass in the Mediterranean ‚Äî could be represented by an ecological state token with data on the seagrass meadows‚Äô health.</li><li><strong><strong>Composable Ecological Tokens</strong></strong>: These would be a combination of the previously mentioned tokens, similar perhaps to how <a href=\"https://toucan.earth/\">Toucan's</a> BCT and NCT represent different pools of underlying carbon credits. Different natural capital and ecological state tokens representing different forests and their respective healths could be aggregated into a single token for financial simplicity.</li></ul><p>In addition to the broad categories of tokens above, the <a href=\"https://assets.website-files.com/5fcaa3a6fcb269f7778d1f87/63297723f700491a0698ab5a_Kolektivo%20Bluepaper.pdf\">Kolektivo bluepaper</a> further details the relationship between these assets and the kCUR Cura√ßao reserve token, as well as the kG Kolektivo Guilder which will serve as the digital community currency for their launch project.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LeUjFsIEL6U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Nature is calling - Kolektivo\"></iframe><figcaption>Kolektivo Promo - Cura√ßao&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"whats-next\">What's Next?</h2><p>Kolektivo remains on track to launch their Cura√ßao-based MVP in Q4 of 2022.
