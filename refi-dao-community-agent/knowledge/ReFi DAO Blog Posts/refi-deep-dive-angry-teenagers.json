These activities will be defined and planned in series of “milestones” that will be publicly available prior to the mint.</p><p>The money raised in the initial mint covers projected costs for the first 5 years, at which point revenue to the project wallet from sales of carbon credits is expected to cover many times the required ongoing investment to protect the forest as it grows. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1.
