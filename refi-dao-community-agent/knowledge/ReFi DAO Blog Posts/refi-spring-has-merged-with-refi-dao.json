In order to do this, we need to leverage the local events to anchor our community in the key startup regions that already exist. We believe that local communities <em>taking collective action</em> are key to unlocking a global regenerative economy.</p><p>We need less tokens and more real-world assets‚Äîless hype and more impact.</p><p>And we need it <em>now.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/image-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1696\" height=\"1614\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/image-11.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/image-11.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/image-11.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/image-11.png 1696w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/playing-offense-to-create-value-in-the-net-zero-transition-</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"decentralized-technology-unlocks-trillions-in-transition%EF%B8%8F-%F0%9F%97%9D%EF%B8%8F\">Decentralized Technology Unlocks Trillions in TransitionÔ∏è üóùÔ∏è</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-net-zero-transition-what-it-would-cost-what-it-could-bring\">recent McKinsey report</a> showed 11 key industries in the transition towards net zero economies that \"could be worth anywhere from $9 trillion to more than $12 trillion of <em>yearly revenues </em>by 2030\". </p><p>Most of the ReFi movement has anchored itself in the smallest market opportunity around carbon management (capture, offsets, measurement), but the power of public ledgers, decentralized storage, physical device networks, and open science will be key enabling instruments that catalyze the entire transition to a regenerative economy.</p><p>While most of the climate tech community is focused on hard-science solutions the ReFi movement has a unique leverage point in the financial system‚Äîin <em>money itself.</em></p><p>This financial layer has enormous leverage but also a primary risk: Abstraction.</p><h2 id=\"anchoring-refi-in-real-problems-%F0%9F%94%97\">Anchoring ReFi in real problems üîó</h2><p>We believe that local communities will provide a vital rootstock for the global ReFi movement to solve the pressing challenges that face billions of people around the world. In order for web3 to be successful, we can't be a social club for privileged tech bros in developed nations.</p><p>We need to build viable solutions that are <em>easy to use</em> and solve real problems for people all over the world‚Äîespecially in emerging markets. With over 1.8b unbanked people and over 6.92b smartphone users, we have a massive opportunity to leverage technology to build out the core users of a regenerative economy.</p><h3 id=\"the-role-of-web3-in-regeneration-%F0%9F%8C%B3\">The Role of Web3 in Regeneration üå≥</h3><p>The coordination tools in web3 are powerful catalysts for <em>real people</em> to fulfil the OKRs clearly outlined in <a href=\"https://speedandscale.com/tracker/\">Speed &amp; Scale</a>: Electrifying energy, decarbonizing the grid, fixing food, protecting nature, cleaning up the industry and removing carbon. But the web3 tools are usually not solutions in themselves.</p><p>We need the subject matter expertise and lived experience of communities <em>on the ground</em> facing the severity of climate change and the complexity of a regenerative transition</p><p>This is why ReFi Spring plays such a vital role in anchoring the ReFi movement as a whole...</p><h2 id=\"in-person-events-as-an-onramp-to-refi-%F0%9F%91%90\">In-person Events as an Onramp to ReFi üëê</h2><p>In-person events are the perfect community-building technique to gather people across the climate and web3 spectrum and introduce them to the fertile soil of ReFi. </p><p>Thanks to the incredible generosity of the <a href=\"https://climatecollective.org/\">Climate Collective</a>, ReFi Spring has supported over 27 local events around the world‚Äîstarting with the ReFi Unconference from the <a href=\"https://www.crypto-commons.org/crypto-commons-hub\">Crypto Commons Hub</a> in Austria followed by the first ReFi gathering in Uganda!</p><p>This is one major milestone in helping us realize a new and evolved vision at ReFi DAO that has emerged over the last 12 months.

This is a great start, but it isn't enough.</p><p>We need <em>thousands</em> of radical startup experiments that pioneer new economic models. Local startup communities are a key onramp for talent and capital into ReFi movement.</p><p>We need experienced entrepreneurs and veteran investors joining the ranks of regeneration in the thousands.
