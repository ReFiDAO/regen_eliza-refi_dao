As a celebration, we are announcing the first seven grant recipients our new <em>Event Organizer Guild</em> led by the team at ReFi Spring. 🎉</p><h2 id=\"event-organizer-guild\">Event Organizer Guild </h2><p>ReFi DAO, ReFi Spring, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/commonsstack\">Commons Stack</a> will partner to run the Event Organizer Guild to help build local ReFi communities in key startup regions around the world. This guild will take the learnings from our Founders' Circle cohorts and apply them to a new actor: Event Organizers.</p><p>This guild is a sneak peek of a major evolution of ReFi DAO as we pursue our mission of realizing a regenerative economy. It also lays the foundation for our upcoming Founder Guild...</p><h2 id=\"alpha-inbound-%F0%9F%91%80\">Alpha inbound 👀</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/local-nodes-mockup-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1512\" height=\"944\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/local-nodes-mockup-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/local-nodes-mockup-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/local-nodes-mockup-1.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A mock-up of the ReFi DAO website redesign</figcaption></figure><p>ReFi Spring events will scatter the seeds of startup communities that will be invited to grow into Local ReFi DAO Nodes—the first building block in our roadmap of decentralization. </p><p>If you're a founder interested in growing a Local ReFi DAO node in your startup community, we'll announce more information about the prize soon!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe for updates</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/image-8.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1938\" height=\"1086\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/image-8.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/image-8.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/image-8.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/image-8.png 1938w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"a-global-startup-movement-with-local-roots-%F0%9F%8C%B1\">A Global Startup Movement with Local Roots 🌱</h2><p>Our dream is to kick-start a global startup movement rooted in local communities. In order to do this, we need to leverage the local events to anchor our community in the key startup regions that already exist. We believe that local communities <em>taking collective action</em> are key to unlocking a global regenerative economy.</p><p>We need less tokens and more real-world assets—less hype and more impact.</p><p>And we need it <em>now.</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/image-11.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1696\" height=\"1614\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/image-11.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/image-11.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/image-11.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/image-11.png 1696w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/playing-offense-to-create-value-in-the-net-zero-transition-</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"decentralized-technology-unlocks-trillions-in-transition%EF%B8%8F-%F0%9F%97%9D%EF%B8%8F\">Decentralized Technology Unlocks Trillions in Transition️ 🗝️</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-net-zero-transition-what-it-would-cost-what-it-could-bring\">recent McKinsey report</a> showed 11 key industries in the transition towards net zero economies that \"could be worth anywhere from $9 trillion to more than $12 trillion of <em>yearly revenues </em>by 2030\". </p><p>Most of the ReFi movement has anchored itself in the smallest market opportunity around carbon management (capture, offsets, measurement), but the power of public ledgers, decentralized storage, physical device networks, and open science will be key enabling instruments that catalyze the entire transition to a regenerative economy.</p><p>While most of the climate tech community is focused on hard-science solutions the ReFi movement has a unique leverage point in the financial system—in <em>money itself.</em></p><p>This financial layer has enormous leverage but also a primary risk: Abstraction.</p><h2 id=\"anchoring-refi-in-real-problems-%F0%9F%94%97\">Anchoring ReFi in real problems 🔗</h2><p>We believe that local communities will provide a vital rootstock for the global ReFi movement to solve the pressing challenges that face billions of people around the world. In order for web3 to be successful, we can't be a social club for privileged tech bros in developed nations.</p><p>We need to build viable solutions that are <em>easy to use</em> and solve real problems for people all over the world—especially in emerging markets. With over 1.8b unbanked people and over 6.92b smartphone users, we have a massive opportunity to leverage technology to build out the core users of a regenerative economy.</p><h3 id=\"the-role-of-web3-in-regeneration-%F0%9F%8C%B3\">The Role of Web3 in Regeneration 🌳</h3><p>The coordination tools in web3 are powerful catalysts for <em>real people</em> to fulfil the OKRs clearly outlined in <a href=\"https://speedandscale.com/tracker/\">Speed &amp; Scale</a>: Electrifying energy, decarbonizing the grid, fixing food, protecting nature, cleaning up the industry and removing carbon. But the web3 tools are usually not solutions in themselves.</p><p>We need the subject matter expertise and lived experience of communities <em>on the ground</em> facing the severity of climate change and the complexity of a regenerative transition</p><p>This is why ReFi Spring plays such a vital role in anchoring the ReFi movement as a whole...</p><h2 id=\"in-person-events-as-an-onramp-to-refi-%F0%9F%91%90\">In-person Events as an Onramp to ReFi 👐</h2><p>In-person events are the perfect community-building technique to gather people across the climate and web3 spectrum and introduce them to the fertile soil of ReFi. </p><p>Thanks to the incredible generosity of the <a href=\"https://climatecollective.org/\">Climate Collective</a>, ReFi Spring has supported over 27 local events around the world—starting with the ReFi Unconference from the <a href=\"https://www.crypto-commons.org/crypto-commons-hub\">Crypto Commons Hub</a> in Austria followed by the first ReFi gathering in Uganda!</p><p>This is one major milestone in helping us realize a new and evolved vision at ReFi DAO that has emerged over the last 12 months. In 2022 we supported over <a href=\"https://refi-dao.notion.site/ReFi-DAO-Founders-Circles-Cohort-02-02e0b226b96f486eb3811e4e58e54d70\">300 founders</a>, and over 70 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCMGuild\">community managers</a> and gathered <a href=\"https://www.refidao.com/submit-pitch\">29 investors</a> into a powerful online community founded on the principles of regeneration.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/Copia-de-IMG_6590---Luis-Carranza-Perales.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1092\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/Copia-de-IMG_6590---Luis-Carranza-Perales.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/Copia-de-IMG_6590---Luis-Carranza-Perales.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/Copia-de-IMG_6590---Luis-Carranza-Perales.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/02/Copia-de-IMG_6590---Luis-Carranza-Perales.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>ReFi Perú 2022</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-sandbox-for-local-startup-experiments-%F0%9F%A7%AA\">A sandbox for local startup experiments 🧪</h2><p>Over the last 24 months, our<a href=\"https://refidao.com/\"> impact X web3 database</a> with <a href=\"https://www.impacta.finance/\">Impacta Finance</a> has seen over 600 projects emerge. This is a great start, but it isn't enough.</p><p>We need <em>thousands</em> of radical startup experiments that pioneer new economic models. Local startup communities are a key onramp for talent and capital into ReFi movement.</p><p>We need experienced entrepreneurs and veteran investors joining the ranks of regeneration in the thousands.
