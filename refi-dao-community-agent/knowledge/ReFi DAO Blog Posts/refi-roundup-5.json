KlimaDAO has been a staple of the #ReFi ecosystem since its launch last fall, uniting people from an array of backgrounds around the goal of creating a carbon-backed currency. Many crypto-natives have used the project to venture into the carbon markets for the first time and many climate-conscious individuals have used it to dive into the world of crypto. </p><p>To date, much of the activity of KlimaDAO has been driven by individuals. Klima Infinity is hoping to bring the largest emitters into the fold- corporations. The project will provide easy-to-use resources for corporations that allow them make an emissions reduction pledge, calculate their carbon footprint, and offset their footprint with tokenized credits.<br><br>Look out for the pledge from their flagship partner on February 23rd!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.klimadao.finance/blog/klima-infinity-to-carbon-neutral-and-beyond\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Klima Infinity: To carbon neutral and beyond</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://www.klimadao.finance/apple-touch-icon.png\" alt=\"\"></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dk34t4vc/production/8ef0225d2403216611c4b312a18027320bca7537-1400x700.png\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id=\"ethdenver-connects-regens\"><strong>ETHDenver Connects Regens</strong></h2><p>This week's ETHDenver conference was potentially the largest gathering of ReFi projects and Regens to date!</p><p>Things kicked off on Wednesday with Toucan's #Regenerate event.
