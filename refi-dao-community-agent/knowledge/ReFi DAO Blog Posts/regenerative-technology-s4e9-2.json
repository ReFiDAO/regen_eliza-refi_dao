This episode marks the start of our third miniseries, an exploration of <strong>how technological advancements</strong> can scale regeneration. </p><p>Jessica and Danielle discuss why the tech industry, despite its push for innovation, <strong>remains stuck in extractive, short-term models </strong>that prioritize profit over ecological and social well-being. They challenge this by grounding technology in living systems principles—<strong>interdependence, circularity, and fairness.</strong> This vision reimagines tools as drivers of regeneration, capable of restoring ecosystems, revitalizing local economies, and fostering inclusive collaboration.</p><p>But what does this look like in practice? 🤔</p><p>Jessica and Danielle highlight projects like <a href=\"https://materiom.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Materiom</a>, which uses machine learning to accelerate bio-based material innovation while avoiding over-extraction, and <a href=\"https://fairbnb.coop/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FairBnB</a>, a cooperative platform that reinvests 50% of its fees into local communities. Blockchain-based eco-credit systems, like those from <a href=\"https://www.regen.network/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Regen Network</a>, demonstrate how tech can drive ecosystem restoration and incentivize caretakers through localized collaboration.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-purple\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">🖥️</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"The predominant </em></i><i><b><strong class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">business model of the digital economy is still surveillance and extraction</strong></b></i><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">, and it’s fundamentally at odds with regeneration.\"</em></i></div></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQYeNtxzor4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Regenerative Technology with Jessica Groopman &amp; Danielle Lanyard | S4E9: Regeneration Nexus\"></iframe></figure><p>Key insights from Episode 9 include... 💡</p><ul><li><strong>Redefining technology’s purpose</strong>: Moving beyond centralized, top-down solutions to tools that adapt to local needs, foster collaboration, and reflect the interconnectedness of living systems.</li><li><strong>Barriers to transformation</strong>: Exploring challenges like short-term financial incentives, the dominance of techno-solutionism, and the cultural inertia of the tech industry.</li><li><strong>Learning from nature’s systems</strong>: How natural principles like feedback loops, localized flows, and adaptability can inspire more regenerative innovation.</li><li><strong>Practical examples of regeneration</strong>: Real-world projects that are already embedding these principles into design, offering glimpses of a future where technology supports life instead of depleting it.</li></ul><p>🎧 <strong>Tune in to Episode 9</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/12QDlRIe0ZCbyZkGDqab0O?si=4eb48663f1d74296\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spotify</a></li><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/regenerative-technology-with-jessica-groopman-danielle/id1609683147?i=1000678182878\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apple</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQYeNtxzor4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YouTube</a></li></ul><p>And don’t forget!
