It's an exciting time to be a part of the #ReFi movement - if you're interested to learn more about ReFi, get involved in the movement, or have a story you want included in the newsletter, reach out to us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiDAOist\">@ReFiDAOist</a>!</p><hr><h2 id=\"nori-announces-7m-series-a\"><strong>Nori Announces $7M Series A</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://nori.com/\">Nori</a>, the carbon removal marketplace, recently announced a $7 million Series A round led by <a href=\"https://m13.co/\">M13</a> with participation from <a href=\"https://toyota.ventures/\">Toyota Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.placeholder.vc/\">Placeholder</a>. </p><p>Blockchain has been at the center of Nori since its inception, as it was spun out of a 2017 blockchain hackathon project. Currently, the company uses the Ethereum blockchain to store project metadata and facilitate transactions of its Nori Removal Tonnes, or NRTs. The first order of business with the new funding is to reduce the company's environmental impact by migrating the application to Polygon. </p><p>The company is also expected to release a NORI token later this year. NORI will effectively act as a currency in the Nori ecosystem. The company plans to sell NORI over time to finance the company's growth.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/24/nori-series-a-carbon-blockchain/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Immune to irony, Nori puts a carbon market on the blockchain – TechCrunch</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">The Ethereum blockchain isn’t exactly the first thing that springs to mind when you’re thinking of solutions to climate problems, but that’s what Nori has built as an engine to encourage farmers to use carbon-negative farming methods to pull carbon from the air and put it back int…</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cropped-cropped-favicon-gradient.png?w&#x3D;192\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">TechCrunch</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Haje Jan Kamps</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Untitled-3.jpg?w&#x3D;764\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id=\"dclimate-partners-with-namibia\"><strong>dClimate Partners with Namibia</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dClimateDAO\">dClimate</a> is a decentralized network for collecting, distributing and analyzing climate data. On Thursday, the organization announced a partnership with the Republic of Namibia through the University of Namibia.</p><p>dClimate will establish a blockchain registry and verification system for the quantification of Namibia's overall carbon impact. Here is what dClimate founding partner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SidJhaCEO\">Sid Jha</a> had to say:</p><blockquote>By working together with the staff, researchers, and academics at the University of Namibia, we will be able to verify the country’s carbon credits to help support ongoing green hydrogen projects within the country. This not only represents an exciting use case for how blockchain technology can power climate action, but for how countries can leverage decentralized climate data to support sustainability projects.</blockquote><p>This is one of the first direct partnerships between a Web3 project and a sovereign nation and it is incredibly exciting that it has happened in the climate space. Hopefully this is the first of many more to come!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://dclimate.medium.com/dclimate-partners-with-namibia-to-create-a-blockchain-native-registry-to-quantify-and-monetize-the-518890e9ef67\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">dClimate Partners with Namibia to Create a Blockchain-Native Registry to Quantify and Monetize the…</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">NEW YORK (March. 3, 2022) — dClimate, a decentralized climate information ecosystem, today announced a partnership with Namibia through…</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://cdn-static-1.medium.com/_/fp/icons/Medium-Avatar-500x500.svg\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Medium</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">dClimate</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*mEDl-gYerXAcKCkmdWN_cA.png\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><hr><h2 id=\"nftree-haus-drops-it-first-artwork\"><strong>NFTree Haus Drops it First Artwork</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.nftreehaus.com/\">NFTree Haus</a> is an organization using the creator economy and crypto to drive climate action.
