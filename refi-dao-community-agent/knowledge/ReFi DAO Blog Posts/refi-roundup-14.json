Including the launch of ‚ÄúGreen Asset‚Äù Liquidity Pools and making Uniswap potentially accessible to almost six billion mobile phone users through the Celo Valora Wallet.</h3><p>Their proposal could provide $10 million in incentives to Uniswap users, lead to the creation of green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2, TCO2, and GNT) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests and facilitate the use of ¬†Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges</p><p>Proposal voting ends on April 29th so be on the lookout!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/16?chain&#x3D;mainnet\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Read more</a></div><h2 id=\"open-forest-protocol-partners-with-ivory-coast-government-%F0%9F%8C%B4\">Open Forest Protocol Partners with Ivory Coast Government üå¥</h2><p>The agreement will lead to <a href=\"https://www.openforestprotocol.org/\">Open Forest Protocol (OFP)</a> working with local communities to restore 5,067 hectares of degraded forest. This partnership will play a role in supporting the Ivory Coast government to cover 20% of their land mass in forest by 2030. ¬†This a vital test for the viability of a promising web3 project whose promise is to unlock large scale regeneration.</p><p>OFP will be working with <a href=\"https://agro-map.com/en/\">Agro-Map</a>, a local Ivorian company renowned for its forestation expertise, who will be managing the project from the ground. Agro-Map will leverage its experience developing reforestation and agroforestry projects with communities and small producers.</p><p>OFP will provide the technology to enable transparent measurement, reporting and verification (also referred to as ‚ÄúMRV‚Äù) of tree planting, and the subsequent growth and carbon storage of the newly reforested area. The immutable and open-sourced nature of blockchain technology will ensure project permanence ‚Äî utilizing OFP‚Äôs MRV will confer credibility of the project to stakeholders, which will foster future support and investment. </p><p>Go OFP!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://openforestprotocol.medium.com/ofp-formalizes-partnership-with-ivory-coast-to-restore-20-of-forest-cover-by-2030-5deb36815a94\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Read more</a></div><h2 id=\"carbon-dioxide-removal-funding-goes-%F0%9F%92%A5\">Carbon Dioxide Removal funding goes üí•</h2><p>After the recent bombshell <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-on-how-to-tackle-climate-change?utm_content=buffere3b3b&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">IPCC report</a> ¬†which stated clearly that CDR is required to prevent catastrophic tipping points being reached ¬†(take a deep breath after the enormity of that statement).
