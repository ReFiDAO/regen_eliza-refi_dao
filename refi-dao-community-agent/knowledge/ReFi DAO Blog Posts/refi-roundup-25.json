It was a difficult process as defining impact is almost impossible, but we knew we needed to find a starting point that we could grow and improve over time.</p><p>The results?  <br>🥁 Drumroll, please ...</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.prime.xyz/prime-rating-app-refi\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/ReFi-Rate-athon-Results.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/ReFi-Rate-athon-Results.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/ReFi-Rate-athon-Results.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>In <a href=\"https://www.prime.xyz/prime-rating-app-refi\">Prime Rating's initial reports</a>, <strong>Regen Network</strong> took the top spot amongst a solid group of A+ projects including EthicHub, MOSS, and Offsetra.  A total of 17 ReFi projects were rated, meaning that while this event was a fantastic start, this is only the beginning (there are currently over 240 entries in ReFi DAO’s growing database of impact projects &amp; initiatives!).  Congratulations to all the winners and we look forward to more rating results as ReFi grows.</p><h3 id=\"massive-room-for-improvement\">Massive room for improvement</h3><p>As you dig into these ratings you'll notice some major discrepancies. We recognized a need to create a system that would standardize the scores across each report to make sure that an individual rater's subjective evaluation aligns with the objective market data.</p><p>For example, we realized that both Regen Network and Moss received higher ratings for Fundraising than Flowcarbon, when Flowcarbon raised a record $70M Series A (by far the most in ReFi). </p><p>We're working with Luuk at Prime DAO to improve the methodology for up-and-coming rate athons and ensure that this starting point takes us forward!</p><hr><h2 id=\"polygon%E2%80%99s-green-blockchain-summit-2022\">Polygon’s Green Blockchain Summit 2022</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/Polygon-Green-Blockchain-Summit-2022.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Polygon-Green-Blockchain-Summit-2022.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/Polygon-Green-Blockchain-Summit-2022.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>On Wednesday, Polygon hosted an successful <strong>Green Blockchain Summit!</strong>  The online event included a full day of talks and panels featuring more than a few of our incredible friends in the crypto &amp; climate space.

Essentially, the Network State includes:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> A social network (community)<br><strong>2.</strong> Integrated cryptocurrency (economy)<br><strong>3.</strong> National consciousness (culture)<br><strong>4.</strong> A plan to crowdfund territory (bounded land)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What do I think about network states?<br><br>This one somehow ended up VERY long, but.... oh well, enjoy!<a href=\"https://t.co/2V3cCuW1T7\">https://t.co/2V3cCuW1T7</a></p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1547104064781127680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 13, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<figcaption>... 5. A recognized founder</figcaption></figure><p>The latter podcast addressed the many crises of our time: climate change, war, exponential tech, AI risks, and the breakdown of the linear materials economy—and identified the common issues that underpin all of them to define what Daniel Schmachtenberger calls \"the Metacrisis.” Chief among these meta-issues is coordination failure (aka “<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Moloch</a>”) specifically in the cases of:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Unaligned incentives<br><strong>2.</strong> Unaccounted externalities<br><strong>3.</strong> Multipolar traps</p><p>Now the interesting realization here is: <strong>ReFi sits at the intersection of all of this</strong>.  We are building communities, economies, and culture centered around the values of regeneration, decentralization, and social &amp; ecological health.  We’re even working on <a href=\"https://rewilder.xyz/\">crowdfunding</a> <a href=\"https://ecorise.finance/\">land</a> <a href=\"https://www.basin.global/\">for</a> <a href=\"https://nft.moss.earth/\">conservation</a> (👈🏽 check, out, each, link).  All with a precise focus on addressing global crises by tackling coordination failures, aligning incentives, accounting for externalities, and creating viable alternatives to the current system.  </p><p>While none of these ideas are new, especially among crypto-natives, it has been fascinating to watch as more and more regens connect these dots, envisioning and co-creating the future of ReFi, and possibly the world, in real time.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ReFi</a> founders and investors, do you know of amazing &quot;localized currency&quot; projects or content?

And if such a nation founded on these principles actually existed, what could that mean for the future of humanity?<br><br>At the same time, the set of crises that humanity currently faces may, on the surface, seem exceedingly complex and multivariate.  Yet the deeper that we each dig into the possibilities of Web3, the more we discover the ideas, projects, and people addressing the foundational issues of the larger <strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/21pNNHBcyJiAHe2g9Yng2a\">Metacrisis</a></strong>.  Will we be able to slay Moloch before it’s too late? <br><br>The answers to these questions are still unknown. But as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WVEP0zAK-xQ?t=4293\">Daniel Schmachtenberger suggests</a>, we need optimism, practical pessimism, and faith in the unknown to continue pushing forward.  And that’s most likely why you’re here.  Through creativity, innovation, and collaboration in ReFi, we continue building out the future we hope to see.</p><p>-<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtFloats\">ThoughtFloats</a></p><h1 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That's a wrap!</h1><p>A special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/climateXcrypto\">John Ellison</a> for inviting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtFloats\">ThoughtFloats</a> to take over this week's ReFi Roundup.  Be sure to follow the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtFloats\"><strong>ReFi Weekly Rewind</strong></a> for a Twitter thread every Saturday recapping the week's top ReFi announcements, launches, partnerships, and news.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtFloats\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/ReFi-Weekly-Rewind-8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/ReFi-Weekly-Rewind-8.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/ReFi-Weekly-Rewind-8.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/ReFi-Weekly-Rewind-8.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>And, as always, if you have a news story on how ReFi is changing the world, <a href=\"https://tally.so/r/3jOz1w\">drop us a line</a>!  Your story may just be featured on next week’s edition of <strong>ReFi Roundup</strong>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://tally.so/r/3jOz1w\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Submit a Story</a></div>",
