Now supporting over 269 vulnerable communities across more than 25 countries, the project seeks to establish Unconditional Basic Income in these communities as a fundamental building block of economic and social empowerment.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://pod.fo/e/144723\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen to the episode</a></div><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEvjDlBGmD0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"ReFi Podcast S2E10: Human Empowerment with Marko from Impact Market\"></iframe><figcaption>ReFi Podcast Season 2 Episode 10 - impactMarket</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h2><p>When looking at global or national averages, many metrics point toward improved productivity, prosperity and overall social and health outcomes over the past century and a half. Nonetheless, the reality experienced by many nations, communities and individuals underscores that poverty is far from being a thing of the past, and that our collective pursuit of globalized capitalism has come at a significant cost.</p><p>Looking through the lens of the <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gini-coefficient-by-country\">Gini Coefficient</a> starts to shed some light on the gap between the highest and lowest income earners in a country. Expressed as a value from 0 (all individuals earn the same amount) to 1 (one individual earns all of the country‚Äôs income), the global Gini coefficient has risen steadily during the 19th and 20th centuries - <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gini-coefficient-by-country\">moving from .50 in 1820 to an estimated .65 near at start of the 21st century</a>. Over this time, global crises have tended to accelerate the growth of income inequality, with early estimates of the COVID-19 pandemic ranging from a 1.2 to 1.9 percent rise in inequality per year.</p><p>And while income inequality can be alarming enough, wealth inequality has grown even more rapidly in recent years. In many ways, the divide between ‚Äúhaves and have-nots‚Äù has never been greater.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/q5KakeWzYx3c9d-nkvor1JTAuMdD67ybrI1IDbDvxqjWSg7f96UqYIlwp1Eiifp9KKsIyqT2yG2rV1Koiaild8Eaj7i6aZKi1Jj3VjPzun-KR7qpEqGTGyMfPVqwK8rqORhRR0lOQ5wQZDVzhjy6vNGziKM3DbhXfTBK43beKRVGL258PnTGEKQm5A\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"380\"></figure><p>Similarly, the most underserved populations struggle to access traditional personal banking and financing, severely limiting their ability to control their own economic and social future. It is estimated that 700 million people or nearly 10% of the global population live in extreme poverty.</p><p>In recognition that rampant inequality does not form the basis of a sustainable economy, some countries have experimented with the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income\">universal basic income</a> (UBI). Though the idea itself has been explored in some form or another for centuries, there are few contemporary examples of the model gaining widespread adoption. For those interested, Wikipedia has an interesting and comprehensive list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income_around_the_world\">various UBI attempts by country</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A new chapter is here for us!<br>From Poverty Alleviation to HUMAN EMPOWERMENT PROTOCOL. <br>Today we give one step further into our mission of paving the way toward financial inclusion and human empowerment.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DareToDream?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DareToDream</a> with usüíô<br><br>Find out more: <a href=\"https://t.co/ApZSv8ZZbs\">https://t.co/ApZSv8ZZbs</a></p>&mdash; impactMarket | $PACT (@impactMarket_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/impactMarket_/status/1566864000331268097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2022</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><h2 id=\"impactmarket%E2%80%99s-solution\">impactMarket‚Äôs Solution</h2><p>Founded in 2020, ImpactMarket platform is an open, free, crowd finance infrastructure, aiming to address poverty and inequality. It primarily achieves this by leveraging mobile-first blockchain technologies that allow anyone to send or receive money in a transparent way, without relying on traditional intermediaries like banks. </p><p>This means that anyone in the world with a smart phone and an internet connection can become a beneficiary of an unconditional basic income.</p><p>There are a lot of mechanisms to dive into for how this works including which communities are eligible, how funding is dispersed and how they mitigate against bad actors.
