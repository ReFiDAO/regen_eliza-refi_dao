Kennedy shares his journey of bringing blockchain and satellite data to Africa’s smallholder farmers through <strong>digital MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification)</strong>, aiming to make climate resilience data-driven, affordable, and community-centered.</p><p>Kennedy’s vision goes beyond tech for tech’s sake. He emphasizes that <strong>for digital tools to work, they must be practical and accessible</strong>, tailored to fit the daily realities of the communities they serve. </p><p>Shamba Network’s approach leverages <strong>satellite data as a climate resilience “oracle”</strong> to provide transparent, real-time insights for smallholder farmers. His work is a testament to the idea that when technology aligns with local needs, it can empower communities to lead their own regenerative journeys.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-purple\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">🌦️</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">“For communities on the front lines of climate change, </em></i><i><b><strong class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">proactive resilience is key</strong></b></i><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">.
