Learn more about the movement <a href=\"https://je.mirror.xyz/S-dpms92hw6aiacUHoL3f_iAnLVDvbEUOXw7wpy7JaU\">here</a>.</p><p>Our small but mighty team of four fervently undertook this task and jumped into the unknown. We could not have imagined the rapid development of the movement and the sheer range of communities that have emerged since we embarked. So far, 27 events have been directly supported by ReFi Spring, along with numerous additional ReFi events occurring!</p><p>Over the past six months, ReFi Spring has contacted and supported an international group of inspiring community builders. We wrote this blog to share information about the diverse themes of events and communities that have shaped the founding months of our project.</p><p>We started out developing open-source resources focused on providing event organizers with funding, marketing materials, speaker lists, and event frameworks. All of these resources to date can be found in our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1UYt6Kj20tNDOmYAiOTjSCFPqJymqthDFHsPJoNSS8/edit?usp=sharing\">Event Toolkit</a>.</p><p>Our focus from the beginning has been to target support where the effects of the climate emergency are most intense: the Global South. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and its impact on communities today, we’ve been dedicated to catalyzing new ReFi communities in this region. We will continue to do so in 2023. Let’s jump into the 2022 events by themes!</p><hr><h2 id=\"theme-1-engaging-new-audiences\"><strong><strong>Theme 1: Engaging new audiences</strong></strong></h2><h3 id=\"refi-kenya\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RefiSpring/status/1579813629633114115?s=20&amp;t=VHq7SY6CrXhnwd7sKxCFpw\">ReFi Kenya</a></h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62c1ab2e724bdb47d13cf746/defe555f-7d26-426d-a865-000efa8b8fd5/Untitled+design+-+2022-12-01T140031.046.png?format=2500w\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\"></figure><p>Kenya is widely known as a leading country regarding strong web3 ecosystem development across the African continent.

Our team is thrilled to see a diverse range of communities and projects taking off as we collectively explore and define this growing movement, bursting at the seams with talented humans striving to explore web3 pathways to enable communities to build a regenerative economy. ReFi Spring will return in January 2023 in preparation for the next season of local events! We are very excited about the communities that have been born, the communities to come, and the conversations that will arise.
