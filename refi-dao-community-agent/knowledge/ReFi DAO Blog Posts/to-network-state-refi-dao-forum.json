In mid-2022, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan\">Balaji Srinivasan</a> - the controversial thinker, investor, and former CTO of Coinbase - introduced the idea in his book, '<a href=\"https://thenetworkstate.com/\">The Network State: How To Start a New Country</a>'.

The model imagined a globally dispersed, but deeply connected organization that takes form as a decentralized network of local startup communities with a mission to catalyze both inner and outer regeneration and pioneer a new paradigm. </p><p>The idea was born out of a sobering observation: existing institutions ‚Äì be they nation-states, corporations, or civil society ‚Äì have persistently fallen short in tackling the pervasive threats of climate change and other critical challenges of our time. The urgency for a leap in innovation across cultural, social, economic, and technological domains is crystal clear. Driven by this realization, ReFi DAO formulated a mission to bring about <strong>a global regenerative economy</strong>, fostered by a transformative global network of mission aligned local communities.</p><p>Yet despite its allure, the concept of a network state is not without controversy. It has sparked a captivating ideological and political debate, drawing in a wide diversity of perspectives. What exactly constitutes as a network state? Why has it become such a popular meme? What is it that is resonating with so many? And what are the lurking dangers, concerns, risks and critiques?</p><p>In this article, we set out to unravel these questions. Drawing upon the enlightening dialogues from the recent <a href=\"https://www.refidao.com/community/working-group/ReFi-DAO-Forum/r/recbjJ1Wa9mZXW9JI\">ReFi DAO Forum</a>, we will dive deeper into the heart of the network state concept - both its potential and its challenges. From this exploration, we will begin to embark on a journey of discovery and co-creation as we collectively sculpt a new vision for a ReFi DAO powered by and for our community. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RegenCoordination&amp;src=typed_query\">#RegenCoordiNATION</a>?

Let's dive in to some of the key insights and reflections.. But first, what actually is a network state?</p><h2 id=\"the-short-history-of-network-states\">The Short History of Network States...</h2><p>The innovative but controversial conception of a network state was originally coined by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan\">Balaji Srinivasan</a> in mid-2022 within his book, '<a href=\"https://thenetworkstate.com/\">The Network State: How To Start a New Country</a>'. Balaji is a well-known entrepreneur and investor, he is the former CTO of Coinbase, co-founder of Earn.com (acquired by Coinbase), and has served as a board member of Andreessen Horowitz, a renowned venture capital firm.</p><p>As defined by Balaji, he characterises a network state as the next evolution of nation-states. He envisions them starting with the formation of highly-aligned online community that takes root around a strong shared proposition or 'moral innovation'. Subsequently the community goes on to acquire land or 'territory' in various locations, acting more like a decentralized network than a contiguous piece of land. The idea is based on the convergence of digital platforms and political entities that evolve from online communities based on shared propositions into actual physical states. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-14.png\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1338\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-14.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-14.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-14.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-14.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-15.png\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1070\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-15.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-15.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-15.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-15.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-16.png\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-16.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-16.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-16.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-16.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-17.png\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1337\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-17.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-17.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/image-17.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/07/image-17.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></div></div></div><figcaption><strong><a href=\"https://gitbook.jur.io/wiki-network-state/network-state-resources/network-state-explained-through-diagrams\">Network State Explained Through Diagrams</a> | <a href=\"https://gitbook.jur.io/wiki-network-state/\">Jur Network State Wiki</a></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Srinivasan compares network states to cryptocurrency's rise to recognition. Cryptocurrency started with numerical significance, gaining traction through increased use and market capitalization, before obtaining societal significance with acceptance and recognition from existing financial institutions (although this has understandably taken a bit of a knock in recent times!). Similarly, a network state could gain numerical significance (population, land ownership, income) and then strive for societal recognition in the form of diplomatic acknowledgment from existing states.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-13.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-13.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-13.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-13.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The key innovations that make network states possible, according to Srinivasan, are existing internet &amp; Web3 technologies. They allow for the building of massive online communities, the start of billion-dollar digital currencies, and development of comprehensive global governance and coordination systems. As such, Balaji argues that such network states are already feasible today.</p><p>However. Given it's radical departure from traditional concepts of statehood and nation-building, as well as the contentious political nature of the concepts covered, Balaji's proposition has sparked widespread discussion and debate. Network states are still just an idea. It is not something that has ever been done before, and many questions and concerns remain. How would existing nations react to them? Would network states ever actually be acknowledged or receive legitimacy? And regardless of the theoretical feasibility, deeper questions also lurk. Do they represent a new frontier for economic and societal innovation? Or are they an elitist techno-libertarian fantasy with dystopian potential?</p><h2 id=\"part-1collective-visioning-%F0%9F%91%80\">Part 1 - Collective Visioning üëÄ</h2><p>Before diving into the nuances of network state, to kick-off the Forum we first looked inwards to collectively imagine the future we want to inhabit and what is blocking us from getting there...

But what is blocking us from getting there?</p><p><strong>Where and how are current institutions, nation states and global systems failing us?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Value Misalignment</strong>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marsxrobertson\">Mars</a> highlighted how current systems fail to account for costs externalized to the future and nature, leading to a crisis. There is a lack of value placed on essential resources like clean air, rivers and abundant nature. <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/montybryant\">Monty</a> also spoke about the need to redesign economic systems, calling for innovations in regenerative finance and the commons.</li><li><strong>Short-term Focus and Externalized Costs</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryledwards/\">Daryl</a> pointed out that institutions fail in long-term planning and valuing future generations. There is also the issue of systemic drive for unsustainable growth, lack of global coordination, and lack of accountability - especially of international agreements.</li><li><strong>Inequality &amp; Exclusivity</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricaa/\">Rica</a> emphasized that current systems are not optimized for everyone and are instead being created by an elite to benefit the elite. These systems often lack local orientation and homogenize groups, voices, and dreams.</li><li><strong>Inadequate Institutions</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gospelofchange/\">Jeremy Akers</a> mentioned how legacy institutions are built for the past and are ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of the modern world. He highlighted problems with centralization, institutional monoculture, and the lack of diversity, representation, and adaptability.</li></ul><p>These points provide an overview of the perceived failures of current systems. They highlight the need for systemic change, decentralization, redefining value, and improved representation and diversity in decision-making processes. The challenge lies in creating systems that can address these issues while remaining resonant and adaptable to the ever-changing complexities of the modern world...</p><h2 id=\"part-2network-states-%F0%9F%8C%90\">Part 2 - Network States... üåê</h2><p>Given the future that is being envisioned and some of the current blockers preventing us from getting there, we then dived into the world of network states to begin evaluating their applicability and dangers as a potential solution... Here is a synthesis of some key ideas shared:</p><p><strong>What are the attractive and exciting ideas surrounding the concept of a network state?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Voluntary Participation and Mobility</strong>: As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandropalombo/\">Alessandro Palombo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklas-anzinger-50031653/\">Niklas Anzinger</a> emphasized, Network States (NS) enable individuals to participate freely and leave at any moment. This flexibility promotes competition and innovation among different NS models. It also aligns with the idea of \"voluntary association\" that <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuayongzh/\">Joshua Yong</a> mentions.</li><li><strong>Innovation Catalyst Amidst System Failures</strong>: As recognized by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbellison/\">John Ellison</a>, <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/montybryant\">Monty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandropalombo/\">Alessandro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raamchandrasekharan/\">Raam Chandrasekharan</a>, Network States present an opportunity for innovation in governance and institutions, acknowledging current systems' shortcomings. The potential for redefining state organization, fostering legal and regulatory innovation, and experimenting with alternative governance forms are seen as key opportunities offered by NS.</li><li><strong>Value-Driven and Collective Empowerment</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/muguika/\">Karla</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricaa/\">Rica</a> mention the attractiveness of a state or network built on shared values, rather than geographic location. This sentiment is echoed by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tereza-bizkova/\">Tereza B√≠zkov√°</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-alimohammadi-4b34b3139/\">Shawn Alimohammadi</a> who highlight the idea of how an aligned community around a shared cause could facilitate collective action, and empower citizens to pioneer new forms of socio-ecological activism while promoting faster deployment and enhanced coordination.</li><li><strong>Environmental Regeneration</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandraponcedeleon/\">Sandra Ponce de Le√≥n</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbellison/\">John</a> bring forth the idea of environmental regeneration and harmonious co-existence with the Earth. They suggest NS can play a significant role in this process by crowdfunding nature regeneration projects and redesigning the money system to be more regenerative.</li></ul><p>The overall consensus seems to be that NS offer an opportunity for radical innovation in governance and social organization, fuelled by decentralization, voluntary participation, technological advancements, and community alignment around shared values and goals.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-34.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image-34.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/image-34.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/image-34.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.discoursemagazine.com/ideas/2022/02/09/from-nation-states-to-network-states/\">From Nation-States to Network States </a>| <a href=\"https://www.discoursemagazine.com/\">Discourse</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What are the dangers, concerns, or risks surrounding the concept of a network state?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Exclusion and Inequality</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuayongzh/\">Joshua</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/timgoudzand/\">Tim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-alimohammadi-4b34b3139/\">Shawn</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raamchandrasekharan/\">Raam</a> articulated concerns that Network States might inadvertently exacerbate socio-economic inequalities through exclusion of certain societal groups, wealth concentration, and accessibility challenges in emerging economies. Coupled with potential cultural, linguistic, and physical barriers, as well as risks of nationalist or anti-foreign bias, these could lead to neo-colonial practices &amp; conflict unless local stakeholders are actively included.</li><li><strong>Conflict and Abuse</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tereza-bizkova/\">Tereza</a>, <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/montybryant\">Monty</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryledwards/\">Daryl</a> were also concerned about the potential for conflict, both within network states and with existing nation states. They worried about governance issues, extraction, and the potential for network states to replicate problems found in traditional systems. <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/montybryant\">Monty</a>, in particular, highlighted the dangers of creating competitive exit-based states that are likely to further perpetuate dynamics of rivalry and conflict.</li><li><strong>Legitimacy and Recognition:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandraponcedeleon/\">Sandra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/muguika/\">Karla</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiulioQuarta_\">Giulio</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincomas/\">Martin</a> expressed skepticism about whether network states could ever gain diplomatic recognition or legitimacy. They also questioned the focus on this goal, suggesting that it could be naive and unrealistic.</li><li><strong>Critique of the Underlying Philosophy</strong>: Several respondents including <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raamchandrasekharan/\">Raam</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cifuenteslobo\">Claudio</a>, and <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/montybryant\">Monty</a> also expressed doubts about the philosophical underpinnings of network states and the underlying ideology of Balaji. They were skeptical of the focus on exit over engagement, the potential for falling back into extractive dynamics, and the risk of network states being a meme that is propagated by masculine-centric and egotistical elites.</li></ul><p>In general, while the respondents recognized the innovative potential of network states, they also cautioned against rushing into the concept without thoroughly examining its implications and potential risks. They advocated for careful consideration of issues like inequality, exclusion, conflict, and governance, and they emphasized the importance of community, inclusivity, and engagement over the pursuit of independence and diplomatic recognition.</p><h2 id=\"part-3a-refi-network-state-%F0%9F%8C%B1\">Part 3 - A ReFi Network State? üå±</h2><p>Now that we had explored both the potential and the concerns around the network state concept, we then embarked on an exercise to collectively scrutinise the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/ReFi-DAO-Network-State-Initial-Proposal-Hypothesis-Feb16th-2023-920abdb38fb34ca2aeeaae4d1f56c561?pvs=4\">original draft proposal</a> written in February 2022 of forming a ReFi Network State.

Individuals can be members of multiple Coordi-nations, fostering a rich landscape of co-existing identity.</p><h2 id=\"forum-conclusion-key-action-points-%F0%9F%8E%AC\">Forum Conclusion &amp; Key Action Points üé¨</h2><p>So considering the awesome foundations of Coordi-nations and acting on the collective insights &amp; intelligence generated from this vibrant Forum session - What is next? Here is a summary of the strategically most important next steps for ReFi DAO to address and act upon:</p><ul><li><strong>Reframing the Concept</strong>: There is a clear need to move away from the term 'network state,' which has been identified as potentially problematic due to its inherent and divisive political and ideological implications. Instead, terms like 'coordi-nation,' 'network society,' or 'startup society' are suggested as more fitting. The team needs to steer discussions and actions towards these more cooperative, regenerative, and inclusive terminologies that reflect the essence of what ReFi DAO is actually aiming to build.</li><li><strong>Shifting Focus away from National Sovereignty and Diplomatic Recognition</strong>: Based on the insights and feedback from the session, there seems to be a consensus that striving for national sovereignty and diplomatic recognition might not be the most pragmatic or desirable route for ReFi DAO. The core team needs to shift its focus away from these political objectives towards building on the powerful network organization that ReFi DAO already represents.</li><li><strong>Building on Existing Strengths &amp; be Collaborative</strong>: Rather than seeking to form a sovereign state, ReFi DAO should aim to work as a partner alongside existing nations and institutions, potentially taking on a more integrated political role. Emphasizing the significance of community engagement and local-first approaches, the organization should build a sustainable and distributed value chain that centers on local communities and end-users.</li><li><strong>Facilitate Inclusive Community Dialogue and Effective Governance</strong>: ReFi DAO should continue engaging the community in robust discussions and decision making processes to ensure the actions and outcomes align with the community's needs. Moreover, the organization should further develop clear, fair, efficient and more formalized governance systems which could encompass community proposal systems, community voting, and the potential formation of a ReFi DAO Council or Committee. This evolving organizational and governance design should enable progressive decentralization and empower wider community participation and contributions.</li></ul><p>Overall, the forum was a true testament to the power of collective intelligence and shared passion in action. Although participants represented a broad array of organizations, initiatives and perspectives, from <a href=\"https://www.refidao.com/community/local\">ReFi DAO Nodes</a> and <a href=\"https://infinitavc.com/\">Network State advocates</a>, to <a href=\"https://crypto-commons.org/\">Crypto Commons Association</a> and <a href=\"https://theblockchainsocialist.com/\">The Blockchain Socialist</a>, they were united by a common thread: an unwavering commitment to exploring and shaping the future of decentralized, regenerative systems for a more sustainable and equitable world.
