The platform ensures that these projects are both scientifically rigorous and easily understandable, catering to a diverse audience from the scientific community to local elders. </p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.regen.network/\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Discover Regen Network</a></div><p>A pivotal aspect is its emphasis on decentralized local impact decision-making, allowing communities to have control and govern their own restoration endeavours. This decentralization ethos extends to its technical backbone: Regen Network is built on <a href=\"https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html\">Tendermint</a> consensus, forming the foundational layer of the <a href=\"https://cosmos.network/\">Cosmos ecosystem</a>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Environmental-Asset-Markets-and-Community-Impact-with-Sarah-Baxendell-e297gcs\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/refipodcast/episodes/Environmental-Asset-Markets-and-Community-Impact-with-Sarah-Baxendell-e297gcs\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen on Spotify ðŸŽ§</a></div><hr><h2 id=\"empowering-women-in-the-blockchain-space-%F0%9F%AA%B7\">Empowering Women in the Blockchain Space ðŸª·</h2><p>Sarah, a fervent advocate for gender equality in the blockchain world, shared both shocking and inspiring experiences from her journey. While many events and meetings predominantly spotlight men, oblivious to the wealth of knowledge and expertise that women bring to the table, there are a few glimmers of hope.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-nbXl7u-Cs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Environmental Asset Markets and Community Impact with Sarah Baxendell â”‚Season 3 Episode 2 ðŸŽ§\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/b-nbXl7u-Cs\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch ðŸ“º</a></div><p>Encouragingly, some events are realizing this gender gap, providing women the platform to lead technical presentations and voice their perspectives. However, Sarah's encounters and those of her peers unveil a deeper, more concerning underbelly. Reports of harassment, exploitation, and disrespect are alarmingly recurrent. The dominance of \"mostly white boys on Zoom\" is not just a superficial observation but a glaring reflection of the systemic bias. </p><p>Sarahâ€™s stand is clear: organizations lacking female representation at decision-making levels need to introspect. By neglecting to promote women, they're perpetuating the problem. Addressing this imbalance isnâ€™t just about equality; it's about valuing diverse perspectives that drive innovation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Environmental-Asset-Markets-and-Community-Impact-with-Sarah-Baxendell-e297gcs\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/refipodcast/episodes/Environmental-Asset-Markets-and-Community-Impact-with-Sarah-Baxendell-e297gcs\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen on Spotify ðŸŽ§</a></div><hr><h2 id=\"share-your-thoughts-%F0%9F%92%9A\">Share your thoughts! ðŸ’š</h2><p>Would you like to share your perspective on this podcast episode?
