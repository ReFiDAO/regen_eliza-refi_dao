Beginning in Ireland with studies in multimedia, his trajectory shot from marketing to design, achieving rapid success. However, beneath the material achievements lay discontent. Searching for answers, Matt journeyed across India and Sri Lanka, arriving to Silicon Valley. It was during these travels that he confronted a spiritual void, leading him back to a rediscovery of spirituality on his own terms. From a sceptical teenager to a soul awakened, Matt's story is a reminder of the transformative power of introspection. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQKHsc3eaqw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Regeneration, AI &amp; Consciousness with Matt Cyrankiewicz │Season 3 Episode 3 🎧\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mQKHsc3eaqw\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch 📺</a></div><hr><h2 id=\"from-silicon-valley-to-hoo-koo-e-koo-%F0%9F%8C%90\">From Silicon Valley to HOO KOO E KOO 🌐</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1888\" height=\"726\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image-2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image-2.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/image-2.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image-2.png 1888w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Embarking on a journey across 60 countries, inspired by the digital nomad wave, Matt embraced a limited workweek ethos. Yet, the undeniable environmental and social issues he witnessed created a dissonance. <a href=\"https://hookooekoo.co/\">HOO KOO E KOO</a>, the project he founded, was soon reoriented with a mission: 'building a better future'. As it evolved, his personal quest veered towards the essence of happiness. Long-standing melancholy from his teen years, intertwined with my religious scepticism, gave way as he rediscovered spirituality outside traditional doctrines. Embracing Buddhism and plant medicine, he found an equilibrium.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Regeneration--AI--Consciousness-with-Matt-Matt-Cyrankiewicz-e29e0c9\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/refipodcast/episodes/Regeneration--AI--Consciousness-with-Matt-Matt-Cyrankiewicz-e29e0c9\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen 🎧</a></div><hr><h2 id=\"future-quests-bold-beginning-in-web3-%F0%9F%90%89\">Future Quest's Bold Beginning in Web3 🐉</h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1807\" height=\"704\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/image-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/image-1.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/image-1.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/image-1.png 1807w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In response to the landscape of 2020, Matt and his team created <a href=\"https://future.quest/\">Future Quest</a>, a community-based accelerator for high-impact climate projects leveraging web3, gamification and science.<br><br>Pioneering into the Web3 realm, they amalgamated concepts from <a href=\"https://futurehorizon.to/events/fh20221\">Future Horizon Rio</a> and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

Yet, the undeniable truth remains that genuine affection and mutual respect form the cornerstone of human societies. Children, devoid of love, suffer, emphasizing that beyond the race for peak performance and biohacking, the human soul thrives on connection. </p><p>As we witness a resurgence of collaborative communities, it becomes apparent that the way forward lies in compassionate togetherness. But while humans remain resilient, our environment is not.</p><p>The serenity of our environment directly influences human well-being. Thus, as much as we need to ensure the survival of endangered species, it's equally crucial to nurture human bonds and acknowledge their interdependence with the natural world. This balance, once achieved, is the key to a harmonious future.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQKHsc3eaqw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Regeneration, AI &amp; Consciousness with Matt Cyrankiewicz │Season 3 Episode 3 🎧\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mQKHsc3eaqw\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch 📺</a></div><hr><h2 id=\"share-what-you-think-%F0%9F%92%9A\">Share what you think! 💚</h2><p>Would you like to share your thoughts on this podcast episode?
