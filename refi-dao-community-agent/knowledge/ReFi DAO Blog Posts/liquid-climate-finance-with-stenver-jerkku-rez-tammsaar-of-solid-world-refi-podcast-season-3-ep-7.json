These are two serial entrepreneurs with a wealth of experience in climate finance and software engineering. Stenver and Rez got industry insights into the challenges of the carbon market during their previous successful venture <a href=\"https://www.eagronom.com/\">eAgronom</a>.</p><p>They developed a hypothesis about how to finance projects in a way that actually works for the project developers on the ground, and after many months of engineering, fundraising and partnerships have launched their platform with a sizable supply of pre-paid carbon credits from top project developers like <a href=\"https://vlinderclimate.com/\">Vlinder</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.allcot.com/\">Allcot</a>. Along the way, Solid World built an all-star line-up of industry partners including <a href=\"https://mclighthouse.com/\">Mastercard Lighthouse</a>, <a href=\"https://starcb.com/\">StarCB</a>, <a href=\"https://toucan.earth/\">Toucan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dclimate.net/\">dClimate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openforestprotocol.org/\">Open Forest Protocol</a>, <a href=\"https://mangrovedao.earth/\">Mangrove DAO</a> and <a href=\"https://climatecollective.org/\">Climate Collective</a>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-13.03.39.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"856\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-13.03.39.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-13.03.39.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-13.03.39.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-13.03.39.png 2332w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This liquid forward financing innovation that Solid World provides is nothing short of revolutionary, solving a key bottleneck in the current carbon credit project development lifecycle: Forward financing. </p><p>In other words, Solid World's innovation ensures they receive the necessary capital upfront, enabling projects to take climate action now, as opposed to waiting three to five years to get their first batch of credits issued! The traditional voluntary carbon market has been negotiating bi-lateral 'over the counter' deals to provide these type of financing mechanisms, but now thanks to Solid World and their <a href=\"https://www.solid.world/crisp\">CRISP framework</a>, the industry has a liquid supply of pre-purchased carbon credits for both mangrove restoration and clean cookstoves—already reaching over $2M TVL since launching this summer.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3q8EakRL7Q\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch the episode 📺</a></div><p>The discussion delved deeper into the technological foundations and methodologies adopted by Solid World. Their approach to risk assessment and the potential expansion beyond the voluntary carbon market offers a massive expanding horizon of opportunities. </p><h3 id=\"the-og-story-of-refi\">The OG Story of ReFi</h3><p>We also touch on the real story of how ReFi got started, which not many people seem to talk about! 👇</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do you know the OG story of how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ReFi</a> got started...?<br><br>... which token financed the world's most successful mangrove restoration project in the world?<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stenverjerkku?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@stenverjerkku</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xRez?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@0xRez</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solidworldhq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@solidworldhq</a> drop one from the history books!<br><br>Stay tuned for the full episode on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiPodcast?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ReFiPodcast</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/xgxQCPRPaQ\">pic.twitter.com/xgxQCPRPaQ</a></p>— jE ❤️🌍🙏 Regeneration (@climateXcrypto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/climateXcrypto/status/1707806735811871226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 29, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><p><strong>This episode covers:</strong></p><p>[00:00:00] Teaser<br>[00:00:46] Introduction<br>[00:02:31] Who is Stenver Jerkku?<br>[00:05:20] Who is Rez Tammsaar?<br>[00:06:53] The Limitations of the Current Financial Instruments<br>[00:10:00] Solid World: How Does It Work And Who Is It For<br>[00:13:48] Liquidity &amp; Trust<br>[00:16:11] From Order Books to Web3<br>[00:18:52] Using Market Activity to Set Liquidity Pool Parameters<br>[00:20:03] Redefining Carbon Markets<br>[00:22:09] Building Resilient Systems: The Robustness of Crisp-M<br>[00:29:46] The Origins of ReFi: Myanmar 1764 and TreeCoin<br>[00:38:09] The CRISP Framework and the Pursuit of Transparent Climate Action<br>[00:44:50] Assessing Carbon Credit Risk and Ensuring Quality<br>[00:42:01] Commitment, Innovation, and the Current State of the Market<br>[00:56:16] Navigating the Digital Frontier</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://pod.fo/e/1f8beb\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen 🎧</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How can we finance real-world climate action at scale?<br><br>In this week's episode of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiPodcast?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ReFiPodcast</a> we dive deep into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solidworldhq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@solidworldhq</a>'s answer with two of the brightest minds in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ReFi</a>: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stenverjerkku?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@stenverjerkku</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xRez?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@0xRez</a>.<br><br>🎞 <a href=\"https://t.co/DoCIuFjLCB\">https://t.co/DoCIuFjLCB</a><br>🎧 <a href=\"https://t.co/bcqpzj8pxw\">https://t.co/bcqpzj8pxw</a><br><br>We touch on:<br><br>🏔… <a href=\"https://t.co/tG2TO2w1GH\">pic.twitter.com/tG2TO2w1GH</a></p>— jE ❤️🌍🙏 Regeneration (@climateXcrypto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/climateXcrypto/status/1714609629265543285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><h2 id=\"solid-worlds-massive-growth-%F0%9F%93%88\">Solid World's MASSIVE growth 📈</h2><p>The market is taking onto Solid World's innovation and is fueling massive growth with a 63.6% increase in TVL on Polygon in the last week of September.
