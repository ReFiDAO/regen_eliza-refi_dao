It is home to over 80 million people. More than 10,000 species of plants depend upon the forest for their survival. It is home to some of the most beautiful and rare animal species on the planet—many of whom are on the risk of extinction.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-dao-is-born\">A new DAO is born...</h2><p>Within a few hours Redemption DAO was born to win the auction – but use the land for Nature-Based Services (not oil) and preserve them for the local community. Redemption DAO surfaced as a rapid collaboration between many of the top organizations in ReFi alongside a group of organizers and activists on-the-ground in the DRC. It's comprised of some of the top leaders in the regenerative finance space, most of whom are in ReFi DAO Founder's Circles—showing the deep commitment to collaboration that defines the regenerative finance space.</p><ul><li>Jae-Hee Bae from Civics Unplugged</li><li>Carl Cervone, Dream DAO champion</li><li>Helena &amp; Doug from Spirals Protocol</li><li>Phil from Flowcarbon</li><li>Gregory from Regen Network</li><li>Wes from HBAR Foundation</li><li>Mallika from Questa Games</li><li>Holly from Astral Protocol</li><li>James from Helios</li><li>Gloria and Ben from Gitcoin</li><li>Cyrus from Eden Dao</li><li>Ale from Impact DAO and FiftyYears</li><li>Max from Carbonbase</li><li>Hayley from Thallo</li></ul><p>With a full list of organizations and contributors involved here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wO1WkenLQuKuPGNkwcaJGCM2O8y9FC00UquY2nI5KXQ/edit#gid=0\">RedemptionDAO Orgs</a></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://discord.gg/ZrmkcBk6gB\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Join Redemption DAO</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/image-17.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1055\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-17.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-17.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image-17.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/image-17.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"redemption-daos-theory-of-change\">Redemption DAO's theory of change</h2><p>In a similar way to the Constitution DAO's $50M bid for the US Constitution, Redemption DAO believes it can rally a community of support around the #SaveCongoBasin story to raise enough funds to win one or more blocks -- and develop an innovative model of co-stewardship of natural assets with local communities.</p><p>Several of the Redemption DAO organizers are in touch with top CEO's around the world, including some of the most wealthy people on the planet. The business case is clear:</p><ol><li>Purchase the rights to use the land</li><li>Preserve land and generate yield through avoided deforestation credits</li><li>Use credits to fulfill net zero commitments, and sell any excess to reinvest in the local community</li></ol><p>If the right events fall into place and humanity gets behind the Redemption DAO movement we may well see a major win for the local communities who have been working on the ground tirelessly year after year to protect the Congo Basin. They've been doing their best to get their voices heard but it took a crisis to bring this to mainstream media.</p><p>This won't just be a win for the DRC, or for Africa. It will be a win for all of humanity as we finally discover how to truly value what matters most. </p><p>If Redemption DAO fails to acquire and preserve any of the parcels of land there's also an opportunity to apply social and legal pressure to the oil companies to preserve the integrity of the forests as much as possible. With the increasing demand for carbon credits, we will undoubtedly see a major shift in geopolitics away from fossil fuels and towards natural resources and renewable energy.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1118\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-18.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-18.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/image-18.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/image-18.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>A slide from dClimate co-founder Osho Jha's presentation at MRV Day June 2022</figcaption></figure><p>Let's front-run the opportunity and show people how it's done!</p><h2 id=\"unpacking-the-auction-process\">Unpacking the auction process</h2><p>At first, it appeared as though the auction was going to be complete by the end of day today—July 29th, but thanks to some digging from French-speaking friends in Redemption DAO (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyrusofeden\">Cyrus</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ncostrowski\">Nathan</a>), we know have until Q1 2023 to create a bidding entity and submit a bid. </p><p>That should give Redemption DAO enough time to build a coalition, raise several billion dollars and secure as many of the 30 plots as possible. </p><blockquote>“the counting of the offers will take place in public session and in the presence of the candidates or their representatives on the date and at the address below: February 03, 2023 Commune de la Gombe à Kinshasa ”</blockquote><p>Below are several key resources for unpacking the process:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.drcbidround2022.com/2022-bid-round\">https://www.drcbidround2022.com/2022-bid-round</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.hydrocarbures.gouv.cd/\">http://www.hydrocarbures.gouv.cd/</a></li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/1.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/2.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/3.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/4.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/5.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/6.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/7.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/8.jpg\" width=\"596\" height=\"842\" loading=\"lazy\" alt></div></div></div></figure><h2 id=\"a-moonshot-with-huge-potential\">A moonshot with huge potential</h2><p>The current criteria is heavily focused on experienced oil project developers. It would take significant social and political pressure to get a seat at the table—but this is exactly the kind of feat that would grab global headlines and create a massive shift on the world stage.</p><p>If Redemption DAO is able to bring big capital to the table to preserve the natural world instead of exploiting it for oil—Redemption DAO will have achieved one of the most significant milestones in climate mitigation.

This means an additional 100m people in extreme poverty by the end of the decade. This is a cruel fate for a continent that contributes so little to global warming.</blockquote><p>He formed a coalition with other African leaders in the African Union to form an \"Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program\" requesting $25B over 5 years from developed nations to \"make good their 2009 pledge to spend $100bn a year mitigating climate change in the developing world.\"</p><blockquote>Five billion dollars a year is a small change — the world spent $20tn to fight Covid-19 — but the key is that this initial capital will help Africa to create much more, through new financial instruments and by de-risking resilience projects to attract private investors.</blockquote><p>Tshisekedi didn't get what he asked for, and it's obvious why he would be outraged at the hypocrisy of developed nations who have produced a vast majority of the global emissions to date, have failed to uphold their climate goals year after year, and continue to open new coal power plants and oil rigs in the face of record temperatures, famines, forest fires and biodiversity collapse.</p><h2 id=\"pragmatic-climate-finance\">Pragmatic climate finance</h2><p>With many countries investing billions of dollars in emergent carbon removal technologies with cost curves that decline over several decades—it's clear we need to reassess our priorities with such significant sums of carbon stored in rainforests and natural habitats around the world.</p><p>The cost of preserving what we have is significantly less than restoring what is lost. We need to pressure our elected officials to finance climate mitigation and adaptation in the developing world—as these regions are the home of most of the carbon sinks we have left.</p><p>Mihir Sharma's piece in Bloomberg titled \"<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-27/congo-should-get-paid-to-save-forests-as-carbon-sinks\">To Save the Planet, Poor Nations Need to Get Paid</a>\", is well worth a read to unpack this argument in further detail.</p><p>The Amazon is in rapid decline due to the demand for beef and leather from the developed world with over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/07/the-amazon-rain-forest-is-losing-200000-acres-a-day-soon-it-will-be-too-late\">10,000 acres of rainforest being destroyed <em>every single day</em></a>—equating to the size of California since 1988.</p><h2 id=\"understanding-our-role-as-consumers-and-citizens\">Understanding our role as consumers and citizens</h2><p>We vote both with our dollars and with our pens.</p><p>It's great to see the ReFi movement rallying around protecting both nature and the communities that depend on it.
