This article, however, aims to highlight the conditions for the emergence of a local ReFi ecosystem in a specific South American country which is unique in many different ways.</p><h3 id=\"the-uniqueness-of-suriname\">The Uniqueness of Suriname</h3><p>Suriname is a small but unique country with a rich history, culture, and natural beauty that sets it apart from the rest of the world. There are several factors that make Suriname unique, including its diverse population, its geography, and its biodiversity.</p><p>Suriname, the only Dutch-speaking country in South America, is home to people from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. A country home to descendants from all over the world, including indigenous tribes, Africans, Chinese, Javanese, Hindus, Lebanese and Creoles.</p><p>This diverse population has created a unique cultural mosaic in the country, with a rich mix of traditions, languages, and customs. A great example of this is a mosque right next to the synagogue in the heart of our capital city Paramaribo.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62c1ab2e724bdb47d13cf746/928fde9a-6e99-47e2-b68b-c1fd4a8a5497/Waterkant_Paramaribo_New.jpeg?format=1500w\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"668\"></figure><p>Suriname's geography is equally as unique. The country, part of the Guayana-Suriname basin, is located on the northeastern coast of South America, surrounded by Guyana, French Guiana, Brazil, and the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the few countries in the world that is located in both the Americas and the Caribbean.</p><p>This unique location provides the country with a rich diversity of ecosystems, including the Amazon rainforest, the coastal mangrove forests, and the Atlantic Ocean. Suriname is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world, with a rich array of flora and fauna that are found nowhere else on the planet.</p><p>This biodiversity is of utmost importance for the country and the world, as it provides a valuable source of livelihood for the local population, helps maintain the balance of the Earth‚Äôs ecosystem, supports scientific research, and attracts tourists from around the world.</p><h3 id=\"infinitri%E2%80%99s-mission-of-creating-a-local-refi-ecosystem\">Infinitri‚Äôs mission of creating a local ReFi ecosystem</h3><p>Between the different ESG or green initiatives in Suriname, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/INFINITRI_IO\">Infinitri</a> highlights itself by the use of Web3 to address the challenge of creating incentives to the protection of the forests that covers 92% of the country.</p><p>Blockchain emerged as an alternative to traditional ways due to a set of conditions such as slow rate of national development, fast declining economy and limited access to international financial markets.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62c1ab2e724bdb47d13cf746/9cc7b879-ce71-4dad-9bd8-b637e2f82bdd/Screenshot+2023-02-23+at+14-29-57+ReFi+Spring+2022+Retrospective+%E2%80%94+ReFi+Spring.png?format=1500w\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Infinitri organizing the first ReFi event in Suriname in 2023\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1173\" height=\"661\"><figcaption><div class=\"image-caption\"><p style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\"><em>Infinitri organized the first ReFi event in Suriname in 2022</em></p></div></figcaption></figure><p>Since the first contact with the ReFi ecosystem, Infinitri has sharpened the vision of the relevance of Suriname to the global ReFi ecosystem and has started to prepare the ground for a local ReFi ecosystem in Suriname.</p><p>The first step was the organization of a ReFi event in Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname, where entrepreneurs, scientists, federal authorities, and the local community gathered to learn about ReFi and create links between their projects.</p><p><strong>Now it's time for the next step, the settling of a formal ReFi community in Suriname, aligned around the principles of regeneration, collaboration, and common prosperity.</strong></p><p>This alliance will have the responsibility of nurturing the land for a new generation of startups that will bridge the gap between Web3 and Climate Action in Suriname.</p><p>If you want to know more about it, make sure to connect with the amazing team of <a href=\"http://infinitri.io/\">Infinitri.io</a>.</p><p>This article is a call for the ReFi ecosystem to come to know Suriname and its important place in the world! üåç üíö</p>",
