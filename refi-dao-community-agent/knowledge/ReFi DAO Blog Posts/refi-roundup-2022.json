By the end of 2021, approaching 20 million carbon credits had been brought on-chain and the $KLIMA token reached an all time high of over $3600.

Yet out of the ashes of this decline, and inspired by the idea of redesigning incentives for a positive impact on our planet, a resilient community started to emerge.</p><p>Many more voices joined the fold and fragmented communities of projects began meeting and collaborating.

In September, the blockchain made its switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (aka<a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> “The Merge”</a>) and it represented quite possibly the fastest-ever decarbonisation of any sector ever. <a href=\"https://eth-4-climate.github.io/merge4climate/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">It lowered Ethereum’s running emissions by 99.95% and cut global energy consumption by 0.2%</a> at the flick of a switch! 🚀 Yet the ReFi community is pushing to not stop there - what about the large history of legacy emissions? Throughout the year, many Web3 entities have worked to offset their historical emissions, from<a href=\"https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/the-merge-gr15\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> individual protocols</a> to<a href=\"https://polygon.technology/sustainability\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> whole blockchains</a>.  Most recently, alongside <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Zero_Labs/the-future-is-a-shared-canvas-join-the-quest-to-paint-a-carbon-free-future-with-blocks-garden-bf2629279980\" rel=\"noreferrer\">coalition of partners</a> from the Ethereum Community, Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and Public Goods movements, organizations like the<a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/cop27-leading-technology-companies-launch-ethereum-climate-platform-initiative-to-address-ethereums-former-proof-of-work-carbon-emissions/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> Ethereum Climate Platform</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blocks.garden/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Blocks.garden</a> have launched with the ambitious goal to support the offsetting of the entire legacy carbon footprint of Ethereum itself!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"924\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-6.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/image-6.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/01/image-6.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/01/image-6.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Crypto could go down as the first industry on earth to decarbonize its entire energy history - <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hashtag_click\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Ethereum</a> is just the beginning… ⚡ ♻ 🚀</p><h3 id=\"embracing-diversity-%F0%9F%8C%9F\">Embracing Diversity 🌟</h3><p>But carbon is just one part of the ReFi story.
