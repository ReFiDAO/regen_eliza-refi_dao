Within web3, the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement aims to embody this vision within a new economic system. ReFi Spring exists to support its emergence.</em></strong></p><p>Note: ReFi Spring is now LIVE on Gitcoin Grant Round 15! Please consider supporting our project and donate <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/grants/6243/refi-spring-2022\">here</a>.</p><p>ReFi Spring emerged in what feels like the early moments of ReFi, back in October 2021, when somehow, through the magic of the Internet and the Twitterverse, a collection of Regens (some of us didn’t even know it yet) came together to hold in-person events exploring this emerging scene of projects and ideas simmering at the intersection of web3, regeneration economics, and climate action.</p><p>We quickly learned that there was a lack of resources, finance, and network for burgeoning communities to activate and explore this space. ReFi Spring has emerged to fill this gap and provide the ReFi community with community-focused public goods to enable the growth of this diverse and complexifying movement in a plural and global manner, suited to the scale of problems that we face.</p><p>As part of the still nascent ReFi movement, our work encourages an ethos of interaction, playfulness, and collective sense-making at events. We have the opportunity to generate a new form of regenerative culture, a culture rooted in collaboration and reciprocity within this emerging space. ReFi Spring’s support is not designed to enable standard web3 conference-like events. <strong>Our support enables organizers to create participatory events that generate useful outcomes for their local communities</strong>.</p><p>ReFi Spring’s support is offered through a range of “public goods” freely available to the ReFi community, including:</p><h3 id=\"grant-funding\">Grant Funding</h3><p>Thanks to the generous sponsorship of the <a href=\"https://climatecollective.org/\">Climate Collective</a>, ReFi Spring can offer funding to 50 global events leading up to April 2023 via issuing grants. Two waves of events are taking place in the Global South and Global North’s spring seasons, fitting the seasonal theme of beginnings, renewal, and growth.</p><h3 id=\"event-toolkit\">Event Toolkit</h3><p>A majority of our public goods exist within ReFi Spring’s <a href=\"https://www.refispring.com/refi-spring-event-support-toolkit\">Event Support Toolkit</a>. This toolkit covers topics including how to run a ReFi event, introductions to reciprocal event design, and so much more. In full detail, it contains:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1UYt6Kj20tNDOmYAiOTjSCFPqJymqthDFHsPJoNSS8/edit#heading=h.t3ozspll2e9f\"><em>Event Frameworks:</em></a> a comprehensive set of event elements and advice that organizers can utilize to ensure that the event maximizes interaction and supports regenerative relationships and outcomes for your community.

These events will conclude with creating a visual representation of interest groups and organizations with access, control, or influence over natural resources, land use, water rights, and agriculture within each bioregion. Such initiatives will help participants understand the leverage points, provide signposts for the regenerative finance projects in those areas, and generate momentum for local Refi Spring events.</p><h3 id=\"permissionless-ticketing-platform\">Permissionless Ticketing Platform</h3><p>In partnership with <a href=\"https://dandelion.earth/\">Dandelion,</a> ReFi Spring provides a free-to-use, permissionless platform for event organizers to sell tickets with zero fees.
