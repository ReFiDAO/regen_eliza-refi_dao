It's run on a platform called <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/\">Gitcoin</a> which has supported over 3,700 projects to raise over $50M in 5 years.</p><p>You'll need an Ethereum wallet like <a href=\"https://metamask.io/\">Metamask</a> and a basic knowledge of web3 applications.</p><p><strong>Start: </strong>August 15 2023<br><strong>End</strong>: August 29, 2023</p><p><strong>Chain</strong>: Optimism</p><p><strong>Critiera: </strong></p><ol><li>'Accepted' first-time Local Node Applicants (<a href=\"https://tally.so/r/mK5VYM\">APPLY NOW</a>)</li><li>Returning Local Nodes with Proof of Impact (<a href=\"https://tally.so/r/nG9zJo\">PROVE IMPACT</a>)</li></ol><h3 id=\"what-are-the-eligibility-criteria-%F0%9F%93%8B\">What are the eligibility criteria? 📋</h3><p>Successful applications will fulfill the following criteria:</p><ol><li>Be led by two or more experienced founders</li><li>Founders must make a 3-5 year commitment to regeneration in their city</li><li>Demonstrate a clear and compelling vision for regenerating their city</li><li>Be able to identify key local leaders across public, private, and third sectors</li><li>Be able to gather support from advisors across web3, climate, and social justice</li><li>Demonstrate event organizing and community building competence</li></ol><p>Nodes are not designed to be led by a single person or project. They are designed to bring multiple stakeholders together and foster cross-sector collaboration with local regeneration as the common goal.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-local-nodes-%F0%9F%97%BA\">What are Local Nodes? 🗺</h2><p>Local Nodes are local startup communities working towards a shared vision of regeneration. They are led by entrepreneurs but are a cross-pollination of public, private and third sector leaders.</p><p>The first function of local nodes is to host monthly events to onboard talent and capital into the regenerative economy via web3 rails. Through these events, we invite nodes to co-create a vision of regeneration in their city and work towards developing open source software and land-based regenerative projects.</p><p>Local nodes are invited to contribute a voluntary portion of their revenue as a reciprocation for all the services ReFi DAO provides: grant capital, ecosystem development, content creation and software. The intention is to create a peer-to-peer global network where ReFi DAO exists to serve Local Nodes who reflect the value they received through voluntary contributions.</p><p>Our long-term vision is to build a mobile-first '<a href=\"https://classpass.com/\">classpass</a> for regeneration' that enables local nodes to cultivate a prosperous regenerative society in their city that leverages membership fees to provide various streams of funding to support regenerative economic development.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-work-%F0%9F%94%8D\">How does it work? 🔍</h2><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> If you are an experienced entrepreneur committed co-creating a vision regeneration in your city, <a href=\"https://tally.so/r/mK5VYM\">apply now</a>!*</p><p><em>*If you're not a startup founder, but you're a great community builder, you can still apply and gather a co-founding team through your events!</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/refi-dao/3ebdc74145684b8bb04cdc0a6dfa969c?v=51ae31f19c78464e86b446c5aae2825d\">Look at the other applications and their progress</a></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Your submission will be reviewed by our governance council and you will be given an applications status: 'Approved', 'Conditional Approval', or 'Denied'.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 3</strong></strong>. We will invite all 'Approved' applications to draft a Gitcoin GG18 grant based upon your application. We recommend using unique branding that resembles ReFi DAO but is clearly an independent, autonomous local organization.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> You will have the opportunity to fundraise for your Local Node in the <strong><strong>Gitcoin </strong>GG18 grant round</strong> from August 15-29 and galvanize your local community by hosting in-person and online events to raise money.</p><p><strong>Optional</strong>: You can host online and in-person activation stations to onboard people onto Optimism and Gitcoin, with a big opportunity for retroactive public goods funding from Optimism!</p><p><strong><strong>Step 5:</strong></strong> All nodes that actively participate in the GG18 round will be invited to participate in the Beta Cohort!</p><h2 id=\"how-much-time-does-it-take-%E2%8F%B1\">How much time does it take? ⏱</h2><p>We get it. Founders are busy. You need to know what to expect.</p><p>Here's a rough breakdown of the core activities assuming you're proficient in using AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney. If not, you can come and learn them with us!</p><ul><li><strong>Drafting an application:</strong> 25 mins</li><li><strong>Create social media profiles</strong>: 25 mins</li><li><strong>Draft a Gitcoin grant:</strong> 25 mins</li><li><strong>Fundraise on Gitcoin</strong>: 1 hour / day for 10 working days*</li></ul><p>*Fundraising on Gitcoin can be exhausting, but also has diminishing returns. We recommend a steady, consistent pace with a focus on the first three days of the round (Aug 15-18) and the last three days (Aug 27-29)</p><h2 id=\"why-would-i-want-to-do-this-%F0%9F%99%8B%F0%9F%8F%BC\">Why would I want to do this? 🙋🏼</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why any founder would want to build a local node. As an experienced entrepreneur who has built many ventures all around the world, I can share from my personal experience, there are a number of core motivations:</p><ol><li>IRL friendships rock 🤘</li><li>IRL events open doors to powerful institutions 🏦</li><li>Our online community has got your back 👏</li><li>Access to funding and influential leaders 💰</li><li>Effective content distribution and discovery 𝌞</li></ol><p>Building a startup is hard. Don't go it alone! </p><p>Build a small local events and community team in your city to create a powerful local network moving towards a regenerative future!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://tally.so/r/mK5VYM\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">BECOME A LOCAL NODE</a></div><h2 id=\"our-theory-of-change-%F0%9F%8C%B1\">Our theory of change 🌱</h2><p>We believe that in order to solve the complex web of existential crises we face, we need new global coordination vehicles. The nation state and corporation have caused this crisis and have proven they cannot get us out of it...</p><p>That's why we're building a network of local startup communities all over the world that are meet regularly in key cities to co-create a local vision of regeneration while onboarding talent and capital into the regenerative economy via web3 rails like <a href=\"https://celo.org/\">Celo</a>.</p><p>Last quarter we supported the formation of 14 local nodes (85% in emerging markets) with over $30k of grant funding via Gitcoin.</p><p>Our forthcoming Local Node Beta Cohort is designed to empower local leaders, providing them with the tools, resources, and guidance necessary to successfully deploy their own ReFi DAO Node. But that's not all - our comprehensive program also includes steps on designing an innovative local node canvas, fundraising strategies, marketing techniques, and governance structures. Join us as we democratize finance and technology, one Local Node at a time. We invite you to be part of this endeavour that blends local action with global impact!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://tally.so/r/mK5VYM\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">APPLY NOW</a></div><h2 id=\"join-the-next-refi-dao-forum\">Join the next ReFi DAO Forum!</h2><p>If you're a local node leader interested in co-creating the governance layer for the formation and support of local nodes, come join us at our upcoming <a href=\"https://lu.ma/home\">Local Node Summit</a> and Forum!
