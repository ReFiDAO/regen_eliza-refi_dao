Our hope is that these building blocks can be leveraged through each cycle to deepen the capacity of this network to make publicly-verifiable impact in the physical world‚Äîleveraging the most powerful tools of our time‚Ä¶</p><p>Emerging in response to the influx of talent inspired by the Toucan x Klima launch in 2021, ReFi DAO was initially an online startup community of early-stage founders. Our vision expanded significantly in late 2022 as we saw the power of combining our online community with ReFi Spring and their network of in-person events.</p><p>Today, we're proud to support a global network of founders, investors, and community builders who are using the power of decentralized technologies to solve the most pressing challenges of our time.</p><p><strong>Impact in numbers</strong>:</p><ul><li>Supported 300+ founders across 3 cohorts</li><li>Engaged 60k+ listeners across 48 episodes</li><li>Enabled 75+ events across five continents</li><li>Formed 40+ local nodes in key communities across the globe</li><li>Deployed over $55k in grant capital to Local Nodes via Gitcoin</li></ul><h3 id=\"glimpsing-refi-from-the-edge\">Glimpsing ReFi from The Edge</h3><p>My journey into ReFi began in August 2021 after exiting my pandemic startup <a href=\"https://goodery.co.uk/\">Goodery</a>.

This search drew me deep down the ReFi rabbit hole and within a few months I found myself invited to serve as an Interim Head of Growth at Toucan.</p><p>This gifted me a unique perspective on the cutting edge of the movement while introducing me to dozens of top founders, investors and community builders from around the world.

To build the first component of this system, we partnered with the brilliant team at Commons Stack to build out the Local Node Prize to incubate autonomous local startup communities that would onboard talent and capital into ReFi through regular events.</p><p>This was the first major milestone of decentralization for the network, using our own treasury to fund the localization of ReFi communities using quadratic funding. Big shout out to Daryl and Anna for their contributions to the Alpha incubator program that supported over 24 local nodes!</p><p>Since then, we‚Äôve run two Gitcoin featured rounds and allocated over $55k of grant capital thanks to the support from previous donors, <a href=\"https://celo.org/\">Celo Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CeloEurope\">Celo Europe DAO</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KnktDAO\">Konekti DAO</a>.
