KUMO has evolved from a natural capital-backed stable coin project into a pioneering lending marketplace, where people can use tokenized carbon credits to secure loans in FIAT currencies like US dollars or Euros. Its innovative lending model is a game-changer for project developers in the voluntary carbon market and has caught the eye of top-tier banks <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Morgan Stanley</a>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/pyGD1fZfe8U\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch üì∫</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyGD1fZfe8U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Unlocking the value of carbon with Robin Klemens ‚îÇ Season 3 Episode 17 üéß\"></iframe></figure><p><strong>In this episode, you will:</strong></p><p>üå± Learn about KUMO's transformation from a natural capital-backed stablecoin to an innovative lending protocol using carbon credits.</p><p>üè¶ Discover how KUMO's approach is attracting top-tier banks to invest in nature as a valuable asset in their portfolios.</p><p>üí° Gain insights into the challenges of climate change and how regenerative finance is evolving to meet these challenges using Web3 technologies.</p><hr><h3 id=\"revolutionizing-climate-finance-with-a-unique-lending-marketplace\">Revolutionizing Climate Finance With A Unique Lending Marketplace</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1134\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/01/image.png 1134w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>KUMO is uniquely designed to bridge the gap between project developers in the voluntary carbon market and climate financiers. KUMO's pioneering approach involves collateralizing both spot and forward carbon credits to provide secure loans. This model significantly reduces the financial risks and lowers costs associated with climate projects, thereby making a substantial impact on the climate finance barriers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/allcot_kumo-launches-lending-marketplace-for-carbon-activity-7143594683615686656-M5ID\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">ALLCOT on LinkedIn: KUMO launches lending marketplace for carbon credits live from COP28</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Together with KUMO, the carbon finance technology platform, we unveiled at COP28 the first ever carbon credit secured loan, marking a monumental leap towards‚Ä¶</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/al2o9zrvru7aqj8e1x2rzsrca\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">LinkedIn</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">ALLCOT</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/D4E27AQH6f6GUUCVqvQ/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1703957123432?e=2147483647&amp;v=beta&amp;t=NWuhKXhIuFpdQOiuUS6F-AsNhTy5EnPNF8pPW8aBB20\" alt=\"\"></div></a></figure><p>An important aspect of KUMO's launch is its attraction of institutional capital.

The <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/cop28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">United Nations' conference</a> underscored a revelation: the financial industry's interest in the carbon markets. This interest was previously uncertain, especially given the market's imperfections and associated risks. However, the appetite for involvement in these markets has become increasingly evident, much to the benefit of project developers who are in dire need of funding.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">KUMO launches a lending marketplace for carbon credits live from COP28 and takes the first step to unlock $10 Billion in dormant value to help bridge the sustainable finance GAP!

Such pre-purchase agreements often led to project developers merely functioning as service providers, without the ability to participate in any potential appreciation of their credits. KUMO's introduction of an alternative funding solution at COP 28 provided a breath of fresh air for these developers. It offered them a way to leverage future emissions as collateral, thereby gaining better access to funding while still engaging actively in the market.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/L25PwN9t4Fb\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Listen üéß</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/refipodcast/embed/episodes/Unlocking-the-value-of-carbon-with-Robin-Klemens--Season-3-Episode-17-e2dvb7t\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></figure><hr><p><strong>This episode covers:</strong></p><p>[00:02:34] Check-in With Robin<br>[00:03:24] What Is KUMO?<br>[00:04:01] The Original Vision Of A Nature-Backed Currency<br>[00:07:48] The Obstacles In Bringing The Vision To Life<br>[00:18:20] The Market Response &amp; COP28<br>[00:22:54] AHA Moments With Institutional Actors<br>[00:29:04] The Composability Layer<br>[00:37:06] The Partnership With Solid World<br>[00:39:00] Unpacking The Black Hat<br>[00:46:31] What‚Äôs Coming Next?<br>[00:49:48] Unlicking A Unique Value<br>[00:55:11] Staying Centered And Grounded</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/pyGD1fZfe8U\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Watch üì∫</a></div><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyGD1fZfe8U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Unlocking the value of carbon with Robin Klemens ‚îÇ Season 3 Episode 17 üéß\"></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id=\"join-the-conversation-%E2%9C%A8\">Join The Conversation ‚ú®</h2><p><strong>Can a nature-backed currency truly revolutionize our approach to regeneration, transforming financial transactions into acts of environmental restoration?</strong></p><p>Join the discussion on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReFiPodcast?ref=blog.refidao.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/refi-dao/?ref=blog.refidao.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a>!
