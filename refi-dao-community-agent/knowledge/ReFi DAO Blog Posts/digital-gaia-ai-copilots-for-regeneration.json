The largest corporations are accelerating their extractive business models through the assistance of large language models like ChatGPT. Over the last three months, 1500+ AI startups have emerged ingesting enormous amounts of data across text, image and video...</p><p>The problem is: These AI models are proprietary black boxes serving a small number of corporations who already have multi-trillion dollar market caps. As users we cannot inspect these algorithms let along govern them.</p><p>In its current form, AI is only going to serve to accelerate the complex web of crises across climate change, biodiversity collapse and social injustice. This 'metacrisis' is growing in severity and complexity and we as a regenerative movement are losing out...</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VH0_HV93_nM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Digital Gaia — A network of AI co-pilots for a regenerative economy TL;DR\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"ai-for-regeneration-%F0%9F%A4%96-%F0%9F%8C%8D-%F0%9F%93%88\">AI for Regeneration 🤖 + 🌍 = 📈</h2><p>In this special episode, I have the great pleasure of interviewing my good friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkauf/\">Rafael Kaufman</a> from Digital Gaia. Rafael is a leading AI engineer with a background at Google who has teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedharvey-digitalgaia/\">Ned Harvey</a> (Harvard MBA, former Managing Director of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/rocky-mountain-institute/\">RMI</a>). Together, they are building a network of AI co-pilots to accelerate the transition to a regenerative economy. They are starting first and foremost in agriculture with a 'Large Land Model' for the entire planet's agriculture and agroecology. </p><p>With very little capital to date they have managed to build a fully functioning prototype that leverages the power of large AI models to assist a number of regenerative agriculture pilots around the world. Backed by Cerulean Ventures and Aera Force DAO, Digital Gaia is now fundraising on Gitcoin in the climate solutions round.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CaB2orgibg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Digital Gaia Canvas Demo\"></iframe></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\" https://bit.ly/digitalgaia\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Support Digital Gaia on Gitcoin</a></div><h2 id=\"empowering-the-underdogs-%F0%9F%90%B6\">Empowering the underdogs 🐶</h2><p>These large models are made up of smaller models that help us understand the health of our soil and the possible interventions for regeneration. It provides local land stewards, land owners and project developers with the AI superpowers of Big Tech but does so in a <em>very</em> different way.</p><p>Digital Gaia is creating <em>open</em> and <em>governable </em>AI systems that allow <em>anyone</em> to inspect the models, assumptions and conclusions. In this way, we are able to lean into the powerful network effects created by the self-replicating AI models that gather intelligence from a huge amount of inputs.</p><p>Given these AI co-pilots are being deployed in regenerative farms all around the world, this  approach allows a farmer with limited resources to understand <em>all</em> of the intelligence across the entire network of regenerative farmers utilizing Digital Gaia. </p><p>This is a total game changer.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/digitalgaia\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Learn more about Digital Gaia</a></div><h2 id=\"breaking-apart-the-black-box-%F0%9F%97%83\">Breaking apart the black box 🗃</h2><p>In this episode, we cover the issues with the black box AI model, the risks presented by AI, and how it can be redesigned to accelerate the transition to a regenerative economy. Rafael spent six years at Google developing AI models and understand the powers and challenges of AI like very few in the regenerative finance space...</p><p>Digital Gaia is currently <a href=\"https://bit.ly/digitalgaia\">fundraising on Gitcoin</a> and is looking for collaborators across the regenerative agriculture, DeSci, AI and engineering landscape. They are a very conscious team of experienced leaders dedicated to rethinking land management, data usage, and incentive structures for a regenerative planet.</p><p>Rafael has also been a contributor on ReFi DAO with his recent Mirror post \"Regeneration: A strategic view\" where he shows a completely different approach for building a scaleable, trustworthy regenerative economy using open data, AI and web3.

They are working to create a system that empowers regenerative agriculture and helps farmers make better decisions that are more sustainable and regenerative for the environment, while also improving their bottom line.</p><p>Raphael, the Co-founder and CTO of Digital Gaia, has a background in applied mathematics and computational neuroscience and has worked for over 16 years in tech, including 6-years at Google, where he focused on search engine advertising and optimization. Raphael's interest in regenerative agriculture led him to co-found Digital Gaia with Ned Harvey, , where he is working to bring AI-powered solutions to the agriculture sector. 🌾</p><p>Their mission is to create digital co-pilots for farmers that can help them increase yields, improve crop health, and reduce the use of harmful chemicals. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights, Digital Gaia aims to revolutionize the agriculture industry and create a more sustainable future.</p><h2 id=\"get-involved-with-digital-gaia\">Get involved with Digital Gaia</h2><p>Here's how you can get involved:</p><p>1.
