  "html": "<p>Hey everyone - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtFloats\">ThoughtFloats</a> here for another edition of ReFi Roundup!  Many of you may know me as the creator of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtFloats\">ReFi Weekly Rewind</a> tweet threads and news curator for the <a href=\"https://web3climate.substack.com/\">Venturing in ReFi</a> bi-weekly newsletter. We've got tons of recent ReFi news and events to dive into, so let's dig in! </p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/Changing-ReFi-Seasons.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/Changing-ReFi-Seasons.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/Changing-ReFi-Seasons.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"changing-refi-seasons-the-climate-action-trilemma\">Changing ReFi Seasons &amp; The Climate Action Trilemma</h3><p>The seasons are changing.  Right around this time of the year, as summer turns to fall (or winter to spring for our ReFi friends in the southern hemisphere), invariably there is a moment where you can just feel a change in the air.  Over the years our warming planet has made this a little tougher to sense, but if you take time to really tune into the rhythm of nature, the signs are always unmistakable.<br><br>For those of us tuned in to the ReFi landscape, this same “change in the air” can be felt all around us. Here are just a few unmistakable signs of positive change:</p><ol><li><strong>Kolektivo Festival</strong> and the <strong>Curaçao Kolektivo Economy</strong><br>Last weekend, Kolektivo launched <a href=\"https://www.kolektivo.cw/\">the first local Kolektivo Economy</a> at the Kolektivo Festival in Curaçao. Far beyond the simple narrative of “bringing carbon-credits on chain,” the economic framework that Kolektivo is developing is holistic: funding impact projects, empowering local communities, and managing the health of ecological systems.</li><li><strong>Forbes</strong> named <strong>ReFi</strong> in <strong>“The Top Five Web3 Trends In 2023”</strong><br>You read that right: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/10/18/the-top-five-web3-trends-in-2023/?sh=23a62aadb3f2\">Forbes is bullish on ReFi</a>. From the article: “<em>One avenue that is currently being explored is known as “regenerative finance” (ReFi), which seeks to promote financial incentives for projects that restore or preserve “resources essential for planetary wellbeing.”</em>”</li><li><strong>Diversity</strong> + <strong>Interoperability</strong><br>ReFi events have been taking place everywhere. With so many diverse projects and approaches, the key theme at many of these events has been interoperability. This was highlighted in Climate Collective’s recent <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ClimateCollective/unearthing-int-er-ra-operability-at-tierra-de-agua-5cc4d6c80f59\">recap of BICOWG’s Green House Retreat</a> and underscored by Toucan Protocol’s new <a href=\"https://toucan-protocol.notion.site/Carbon-Rosetta-Stone-Standard-Attributes-DB-bb0bb434bf6c4661b45155a84d192e22\">Carbon Rosetta Stone project</a> to foster composability across tokenized carbon projects. (PLUS the start of a new season of <a href=\"https://refi-dao.notion.site/ReFi-DAO-Founders-Circles-Season-02-02e0b226b96f486eb3811e4e58e54d70\">Founders Circles</a> with over 150 founders!)</li></ol><p>ReFi is at an inflection point. We are broadening our horizons beyond carbon, the wider world is beginning to take notice, and we are focusing intently on working together towards a common goal.<br><br>But there’s still a ton of work to do. As Akshay Aditya of de_planDAO points out in a recent blog post detailing the <a href=\"https://www.wordcelclub.com/de-plan.sol/the-climate-action-trilemma-for-the-global-south\">Climate Action Trilemma</a>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.wordcelclub.com/de-plan.sol/the-climate-action-trilemma-for-the-global-south\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/The-Climate-Trilemma-for-the-Global-South.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/The-Climate-Trilemma-for-the-Global-South.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/The-Climate-Trilemma-for-the-Global-South.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a></figure><p>In order to create a positive impact in the global regions most affected by climate change, we must have the ability to 1) develop and execute a plan 2) secure adequate funding, and 3) deploy quickly with lasting results. He notes, <em>“ReFi is currently solving for different parts of the climate problem and has yet to arrive at a solution which addresses the trilemma.”</em><br><br>However this might be the entire point. The diversity of ReFi allows each project to work on solving a tiny piece of the puzzle. The launch of the Curaçao Kolektivo Economy demonstrates how projects can develop and execute a plan. Forbes article suggests even more sources of capital will be waking up to the space. And as the many diverse ReFi projects find ways to interoperate and collaborate, newer projects will be able to deploy and scale at greater speed. As we continue working together, it may be possible for the collective ReFi ecosystem to address each edge of the Climate Action Trilemma on multiple interoperating dimensions.<br><br>There is a seasonal change in the air. ReFi is building toward a new paradigm and the signs are unmistakable.</p><hr><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1W2YFeckJQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"ReFi Podcast S2E13: Scaling Carbon Markets with Dana and Phil from Flowcarbon\"></iframe></figure><h2 id=\"scaling-carbon-markets-with-flowcarbon\">Scaling Carbon Markets with Flowcarbon</h2><p>On this week’s episode of the ReFi Podcast, hosts John and Simar dig into <a href=\"https://www.flowcarbon.com/\">Flowcarbon</a> with CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danagibber\">Dana Gibber</a> and Chief Blockchain Officer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Philfog\">Phil Fogel</a>.
