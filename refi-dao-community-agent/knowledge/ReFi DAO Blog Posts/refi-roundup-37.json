It's the next evolution of what was previously called \"Gitcoin Holdings\" which helped launch projects like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gitcoin\">Gitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x\">Kernel</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/buidlbox\">Buidlbox</a> (formerly Gitcoin Hackathons), and <a href=\"https://greenpill.party/\">The Green Pill Podcast</a>.

I took a peak at the projects and spied one of my favorite ideas in ReFi right now: HyperCertificates!</p><h3 id=\"hypercerts-pilot-launch-%F0%9F%92%A5\">Hypercerts Pilot Launch 💥</h3><p><a href=\"https://hypercerts.xyz/\">Hypercerts</a> are a new tool for building scalable retrospective reward systems, <em>generalized for any impact vector</em>! </p><p>Many ReFi projects build on carbon credits and the voluntary carbon markets. But as David Rodriguez points out in the latest episode of the ReFi Podcast, climate is but 1 of the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> laid out by the UN and carbon credits themselves have limited impact on Goal 13 (Climate Action). To address <em>all</em> of the challenges facing humanity, we need a more flexible building block. Hypercerts open up the world of ReFi to projects creating other kinds of impact such as in healthcare, education, and even food justice (😉). Hypercerts could create a transparent parallel market to the not-so-transparent $41T environmental, social, and governance (ESG) market!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/hypercert_example.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"375\" height=\"561\"><figcaption>Hypercert example from https://hypercerts.xyz/ documentation</figcaption></figure><p>Inline with Owocki's concept of supermodularity, Hypercerts also act as this scalable, <em>interoperable</em> funding layer for public goods. I'm very excited to see how Hypercerts connect different corners of the ReFi world, expand ReFi's scope of impact, and create new opportunities for regeneration 🌱.</p><h3 id=\"final-thoughts-on-hypercerts\">Final Thoughts on Hypercerts</h3><p>I was so inspired by the team at Protocol Labs and all the research they've done in this space I even started doing <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x16E3718701EEe950615720cb37F9dD34B1E36035#code%23F2%23L1\">my own experiments with Hypercerts</a>! Papertree rewards funders with our own flavor of Hypercerts as a way to reciprocate the support they've given in helping us fight food insecurity. Each <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/hypercerts\">Papertree Hypercert</a> represents 1 months worth of food &amp; groceries provided to a local community and its metadata contains all of the transactions and receipts of the groceries purchased, who it went to, as well as the impact period (for future evaluators)!</p><p>I'm looking forward to continued conversations around Hypercerts and seeing this tool and market evolve.
