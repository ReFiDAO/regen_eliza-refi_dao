# Local Nodes Introduction

## What are Local Nodes?

Local Nodes are regional communities within the ReFi DAO ecosystem that implement place-based regenerative projects. They serve as the on-ground implementation arm of the global regenerative finance movement, connecting global ReFi principles with local environmental and social needs.

## Core Concept

Local Nodes operate on the principle that regeneration must be locally relevant and community-driven. While ReFi DAO provides global coordination, funding, and knowledge sharing, Local Nodes maintain autonomy to address their unique bioregional challenges and opportunities.

## How Local Nodes Work

### Structure & Governance
- **Decentralized Leadership**: Multiple coordinators sharing responsibilities
- **Community Membership**: Open to local residents, organizations, and allies
- **Democratic Decision-Making**: Local governance aligned with ReFi DAO principles
- **Bioregional Focus**: Projects aligned with local ecosystem boundaries and needs

### Relationship with ReFi DAO
- **Funding Access**: Direct access to DAO grants and investment opportunities
- **Technical Support**: Tools, training, and methodological guidance
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Connection with global network of regenerative practitioners
- **Governance Participation**: Voice in global DAO decisions and direction
